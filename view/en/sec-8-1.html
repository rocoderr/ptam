### 1. Institutional-Form Type: Direct Democracy vs Representative Democracy

#### 1.1 Why this is an Overlay Variable

Direct democracy and representative democracy are not new ontological axes. They are institutional-mechanism variables about **how collective decisions are made**. They do not, by themselves, answer ontological questions about how power, rights, and resources should be understood. For that reason, they lack the irreducibility required of an ontological axis.

This section does not judge “which is more democratic”. It asks: **under what conditions do different decision mechanisms exert directional pulls on the three ontological axes?**

#### 1.2 Representative democracy: checks do not come from “representation”, but from supporting structures

Representative democracy does not automatically produce power constraints or rights protection. Only under specific institutional conditions can it stably keep the three axes closer to the “+” side.

In the Political Triple-Axis Model, representative democracy functions as a constraining mechanism only when at least the following structures hold together:

1. Enforceable constitutional rights boundaries  
   - basic rights are written into a constitution;  
   - rights clauses are judicially enforceable;  
   - some matters are explicitly placed outside majority vote and protected from legislative erosion.  
   On the Rights Ontology Axis (Z), this implies: rights are treated as **pre-political constraints**, not as products of the political process (Z+).

2. Separation of powers and checks and balances  
   - legislative power is not concentrated in a single body (e.g., bicameralism or an equivalent structure);  
   - the executive is constrained by both legislature and judiciary;  
   - power centers have real veto and countervailing capacity.  
   This segments the production of coercion, rather than releasing it in one shot.

3. An independent judiciary and constitutional review  
   - courts can invalidate legislative and administrative decisions;  
   - judicial rulings are not immediately reversible by political majorities;  
   - the judiciary has institutional independence.  
   On the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y), this is a key line of defense against coercion overreach (Y+).

4. Revocability of decisions and traceable accountability  
   - laws and policies can be revised or repealed;  
   - decision-makers can be held accountable and removed;  
   - the political cost of bad decisions is borne by identifiable actors.  
   On the Economic Order Axis (X), this helps constrain extreme short-termism and diffused responsibility (X+ or neutral).

If these conditions are missing, then even a formally representative system can lose its structural effects. A “formal representative democracy” (a hollow constitution, a dependent judiciary, and de facto concentration of power) can look, in three-axis terms, not essentially different from direct democracy—and may even sit closer to Y− / Z−.

#### 1.3 Direct democracy: constitutionalization is possible in principle, but institutional tension is higher

From an institutional-design perspective, direct democracy does not necessarily exclude constitutions, separation of powers, and courts. In principle, a “constitutionalized direct democracy” can introduce mechanisms such as:

1. Procedural buffering and decision cooling  
   - mandatory expert review before referenda;  
   - mandatory public deliberation periods;  
   - cooling-off periods to reduce emotionally immediate decisions.  
   These can reduce the probability that an “instant majority” becomes coercion directly.

2. Clear constitutional isolation of basic rights  
   - some basic rights are explicitly excluded from referenda; or  
   - referendum outcomes must still conform to constitutional rights clauses.  
   On Z, this attempts to re-anchor rights toward Z+.

3. Judicial review of referendum outcomes  
   - courts have the power to invalidate referendum results;  
   - unconstitutional rulings are, formally, higher than the vote outcome.

4. High thresholds and multi-consent mechanisms  
   - supermajority requirements;  
   - multi-region and multi-group concurrent consent;  
   - time-consistency requirements (e.g., passing multiple referenda in sequence).  
   These are not purely hypothetical; some partial implementations exist in practice.

Therefore, at the level of principle, **direct democracy does not necessarily force a shift in three-axis positioning**.

#### 1.4 The structural difficulty of sustaining checks under direct democracy

The problem is not “whether it is possible”. It is the **long-run cost and instability** of sustaining checks. Direct democracy faces a persistent institutional tension: “who constrains the whole people?”

1. Asymmetry in sources of legitimacy  
   In representative systems, legislature, executive, and judiciary check each other, and none holds absolute legitimacy.  
   In direct democracy, referendum outcomes are often treated as “the highest democratic legitimacy”, while constitutions, courts, and procedures become relatively secondary. When courts invalidate referendum outcomes, they are easily attacked as “anti-democratic” or “elite interference with popular will”.

2. Persistent pressure on constraining mechanisms  
   Even if judicial review and rights constraints exist at the beginning, long-term operation repeatedly generates:
   - political attacks on court power;  
   - demands to restrict or reshape judicial independence;  
   - attempts to weaken checks themselves through further referenda.  
   The more effective the constraint, the higher the political pressure tends to be.

3. Extreme diffusion of decision power and responsibility  
   In direct democracy, decision power belongs to everyone, but outcomes are hard to attribute. On X, this tends to produce:
   - short-term preference;  
   - immediate welfare promises, price interventions, fiscal expansion;  
   - low sensitivity to long-term costs and future generations.  
   This follows from incentives, not moral judgments.

So the claim is: **direct democracy is not incapable of sustaining checks, but the institutional cost of sustaining checks is much higher, and it is easy to destabilize during political crises or mass mobilization.**

#### 1.5 Why direct democracy often produces negative pulls on the three axes in institutional dynamics

The analysis above implies: direct democracy does not necessarily shift the three axes in principle. But in real political operation it repeatedly shows a tendency to slide **toward Y−, Z−, and X−**. This is not because voters are morally deficient, ignorant, or culturally “low”. It is an endogenous result of direct democracy’s institutional logic. The mechanisms can be explained on each axis.

(i) Rights Ontology Axis: why direct democracy tends toward rights revisability (Z−)  
The key question is not “whether there is voting”, but **what is allowed to become a voting object**.

1. The implicit premise: public affairs are voteable  
   In the pure direct-democracy grammar, there is a coherent implicit chain: public affairs → decided by the people; decided by the people → decided by majority vote. Then one unavoidable question appears: **are basic rights part of public affairs?**

   If the answer is “yes”, the result follows:
   - rights are pulled into voteable matters;  
   - rights’ validity depends on the present majority;  
   - rights can be revised, restricted, or revoked as majorities change.  
   This is a formal implication, not a value judgment.

   Once a system accepts any claim like:
   - a referendum can decide whether certain speech is allowed;  
   - a referendum can decide whether some people have a basic right;  
   it has adopted a clear position: **rights are not pre-political constraints; they are products of the political process.** In this model, that is precisely the criterion for Z shifting toward Z−.

2. If “popular sovereignty” lacks boundaries, it consumes rights ontology  
   A common defense is: “the people can also vote to protect rights.” But this does not touch the core issue. It still assumes rights’ survival depends on vote outcomes. The model’s concern is not “whether people will do evil”, but “whether the system allows them to do evil”. If the condition for rights’ existence is “the majority still agrees”, then even if violations have not yet occurred, rights are already **ontologically revocable** (Z−).

(ii) Liberty Boundary Axis: why direct democracy more easily erodes the liberty boundary (Y−)  
A frequently confused point must be clarified: **coercion is not the same thing as state bureaucracy.**

1. The essence of coercion: whether it is non-refusable  
   On Y, the core questions are:
   - who can coerce whom;  
   - whether a constraint can be refused, exited, or contested.  
   The danger of direct democracy is not “state power expansion”. It is that:
   - coercion no longer appears as a state command;  
   - it appears as “the people’s decision” or “social consensus”.  
   But the outcome is the same:
   - individuals cannot refuse;  
   - individuals cannot exit;  
   - individuals cannot legally disobey.  
   Coercion does not disappear. It diffuses from the institutional center into society as a whole. In this model, that is not Y+. It is another form of Y−.

2. Majority rule is not “non-coercion”, but coercion that is harder to resist  
   Compared with state coercion, majority decisions have several riskier features:
   - no clear responsible agent (“it was everyone’s decision”);  
   - dissenters are easily moralized as “anti-democratic” or “anti-the-people”;  
   - social pressure and legal coercion combine into a compound constraint.  
   In such environments:
   - dissent is more easily stigmatized;  
   - legitimate opposition is more easily treated as illegitimate.  
   This is a typical path by which the liberty boundary is compressed at the social level.

(iii) Economic Order Axis: why direct democracy more easily produces short-term economic preferences (X−)  
This tendency is also not a cultural issue. It follows from incentives.

1. Extreme separation between decision power and responsibility  
   In direct democracy:
   - the decision-maker is the whole electorate;  
   - the cost-bearer is society as a whole (including future generations);  
   - there is no clear, accountable responsible agent.  
   This produces three systemic consequences:
   1) benefits are immediate and salient;  
   2) costs are dispersed and delayed;  
   3) no one bears personal responsibility for long-term outcomes.  
   Under this structure, institutions tend toward:
   - immediate benefits;  
   - price interventions;  
   - fiscal expansion and intertemporal overdrawing.  
   This is not “leftward” in an ideological sense. It is the institutional compression of time preference.

2. A mechanism claim, not a cultural bias  
   Even with:
   - high education;  
   - high income;  
   - high civic literacy;  
   as long as the institutional features are:
   - decisions take effect immediately;  
   - consequences are not attributable;  
   the system still tends to generate:
   - short-term orientation;  
   - low sensitivity to “invisible costs”.

(iv) Why this pull is intrinsic  
In sum, direct democracy’s negative pulls on the three axes are not accidental or exogenous contamination. They follow from its core institutional features:

- equating “collective preference” with “legitimate coercion”;  
- placing “popular sovereignty” in a position that is nearly unconstrainable;  
- strongly diffusing decision power while strongly diluting responsibility.

At the model level, the conclusion is: **direct democracy does not necessarily move the three axes toward “−”, but absent high-intensity constitutional constraints, its institutional logic will persistently and systematically pull political practice toward Y−, Z−, and X−.** This is why, under the conditions described above, representative democracy—at lower institutional cost—can be more likely to sustain stability on the “+” side across the three axes.

#### 1.6 Section conclusion

From a three-axis analysis:

1. Direct democracy and representative democracy do not necessarily shift axis positioning by themselves.  
2. The binding constraint is not “representation or not”, but:
   - enforceable constitutional rights;  
   - separation of powers and checks and balances;  
   - an independent judiciary and revocability of decisions.  
3. In institutional dynamics:
   - direct democracy has a stronger structural pull toward Y− / Z− / X−;  
   - representative democracy, at lower institutional cost, is more likely to sustain stability toward the “+” side.

Therefore, “direct democracy vs representative democracy” should be treated as a high-intensity Overlay Variable: it does not determine direction, but it strongly affects the speed, magnitude, and runaway risk of institutional drift.
