### 7. Abolishing the death penalty to absolutize the institutional boundary of the right to life

#### 7.1 Initial Position: a penal structure where the state retains ultimate life-deprivation power

In systems retaining capital punishment, the state holds legal power to deprive life under certain conditions:

- **Z:** the right to life is highly important but not absolute; under extreme crimes it can be institutionally negated.  
- **Y:** the state holds an ultimate coercive instrument; the death penalty is the top deterrent in the penal system.  
- **X:** penal resources are arranged around deterrence and retribution; life-ending is inside the legitimate institutional toolbox.

The state is treated as a legitimate “final adjudicator” of whether someone continues to live.

#### 7.2 Contextual Scenario: doubt about judicial error and the legitimacy of ultimate punishment

This motion is proposed under:

- collective memory of wrongful convictions;  
- empirical doubt about deterrence effects;  
- ethical claims that the right to life is irreversible and non-correctable.

The focus shifts from “who should be executed” to whether the state should be allowed to exercise irreversible life-deprivation power.

#### 7.3 Motion Statement

**To establish the inalienability of the right to life, the state should abolish capital punishment and remove any form of life-ending from the legitimate penal system.**

The core is withdrawing the state’s ultimate coercive instrument and redefining the boundary property of the right to life.

#### 7.4 Structural Consequences: ultimate coercion retreats; the right to life becomes absolute

- **Z:** the right to life is established as absolute, no longer dependent on behavior type or institutional judgment (Z→+).  
- **Y:** the state’s ultimate coercive instrument is withdrawn; the upper bound of penal coercion retreats.  
- **X:** incarceration and correction systems bear long-term supervision costs for high-risk offenders; the institutional goal shifts from “end” to “continuous control”.

The core meaning is denying the state’s legitimacy as life-ending adjudicator and placing irreversibility as a primary design constraint.
