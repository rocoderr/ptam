### 2. A coding framework for academic research: mapping argument structure onto X/Y/Z

The three-axis model can also be used as a coding framework for argument structure. The object of study is not self-labeling, but how reasons are organized, how boundaries are defined, and how rights are understood in concrete issues.

A minimal operational method is a three-step annotation:

- **mark the object first:** is the passage about property/distribution/allocation (X), about who can coerce whom and where normalized coercion boundaries lie (Y), or about whether rights are prior or institutionally constructed/adjustable (Z)?  
- **mark the direction next:** within that axis, is it closer to the (−) end or the (+) end (as a rough relative marker, not a measurement scale)?  
- **mark overlay variables last:** which Overlay Variables explain expression differences across contexts for the same X/Y/Z position, rather than treating them as “new main axes”?

This helps: when a stance carries the same name across countries or historical phases, researchers can still compare whether its X/Y/Z structure is truly similar.
