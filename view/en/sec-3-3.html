### 3. Rights Ontology Axis: Why It Has Become So Important Today

#### 3.1 Why make the Rights Ontology Axis the third main axis?

In contemporary politics, one type of dispute is especially prone to runaway escalation: both sides claim they are “defending rights”, yet they are not even on the same level when it comes to “what rights are, where they come from, and for whom”. Often the conflict becomes more intense than disputes over the economy or governance because it touches upstream premises about personhood, subjecthood, and legitimacy. What each side means by “rights” is simply not the same thing.

- Some mean rights as:  
  > “A boundary that exists prior to politics, which institutions must not cross.”

- Others mean rights as:  
  > “An entitlement or protection granted through institutional arrangements under particular social conditions.”

If these are not distinguished, the discussion becomes mutual talking past each other. The Rights Ontology Axis exists to distinguish precisely this.

Historically, we can see a shift from “premise” to “dispute”:

- For long periods, the ontology of rights was treated as a given premise: rights came from God, natural law, or traditional order. Political disputes were more about ruling and checks-and-balances than about rights ontology.  
- Modern liberalism established universal rights and legal equality, which, for a long time, lowered ontological dispute: people argued more about “how to implement rights” than about “whether rights are socially constructed”.  
- When formal equality has existed for a long time while structural inequality, identity exclusion, and persistent differences in life conditions remain stubborn, disputes begin to move upstream: if rights are truly neutral and universally symmetric, why do outcomes remain deeply unequal? As a result, many movements and counter-movements are no longer satisfied with “implement existing rights better”, but shift toward “rewriting what rights are, who counts as a rights-holder, and whether rights require asymmetric structural correction”.

This is the background for the Rights Ontology Axis as the third main axis: it is not an arbitrary new issue. It emerges because modern institutional structures fail to explain certain domains, pushing disputes back toward higher-level ontological premises.

#### 3.2 What question does the Rights Ontology Axis ask?

The Rights Ontology Axis studies the ontological status of rights and analyzes how rights are understood and justified in political argument. It does not list a rights checklist, and it does not decide which rights “should” be recognized as fundamental rights. This axis asks not “what rights exist”, but “what you take rights to be”—a more basic question:

> In political argument, something called a “right”  
> is it treated as a boundary constraint that exists prior to politics,  
> or as an outcome constructed by politics and institutions?

In other words, are you saying:

> “Whether or not institutions recognize it, this boundary already exists,”

or are you saying:

> “This is a right defined and allocated by institutions in order to achieve certain goals”?

These two understandings lie on opposite sides of the Rights Ontology Axis.

Positioning on the Rights Ontology Axis does not depend on which concrete right is under dispute. It depends on whether, to support or oppose that right, the argument appeals to a set of rights-holder qualifications and rights boundaries understood as existing prior to politics.

**Ontology is about whether something “exists”, where it comes from, and whether it is “created”.**

Examples:

- “Do people have rights from birth?” → an ontological question  
- “Should the government grant more rights to a certain group?” → a policy question  
- “Are supporters of this policy left or right?” → a camp-label question  

#### 3.3 How to define “Left / Right” on the Rights Ontology Axis

- **Left side of Z (Z−)**: tends toward Institutional Rights.  
  - Rights are understood as products of institutional construction, historical practice, and social goals.  
  - The scope, conditions, and subjects of rights can—and must—be defined through politics and institutions.  
  - Conditioning and stratification of rights are more readily accepted.  

  > Use politics to define rights.  
  > Institutions create a boundary that only they can define and enforce.

  Rights are:
  - socially constructed  
  - context-dependent  
  - adjustable asymmetrically by group, history, or goals

- **Midpoint of Z (Z0)**: often a “mixed ontology” stance.  
  - Rights are neither absolutely prior nor purely constructed.  
  - They are applied as balanced institutional principles.

- **Right side of Z (Z+)**: tends toward Natural Rights.  
  - Rights are understood as existing prior to politics.  
  - Institutions exist to recognize and protect, not to create.  
  - Even if the law does not write it down, the boundary is still taken to “hold”.  
  - Universal symmetry of rights is emphasized.

  > Use rights to constrain politics.  
  > Institutions acknowledge a boundary that they cannot define.

  Rights are:
  - natural  
  - a priori  
  - universal  
  - symmetric between subjects

  Rights are not “granted” by society, the state, or culture. They are:
  - prior to politics; basic human rights do not depend on state recognition  
  - grounded in the fact of being human  
  - not dependent on identity, group membership, merit, or outcomes  
  - morally symmetric for all persons

Key distinctions:

- rights ≠ legal text  
- rights ≠ social allocation  
- rights ≠ historical compensation  

Rights are **constraints on political power**, not its products.

#### 3.4 Is it logically consistent to label natural-rights positions as “Right (+)”?

This is not arbitrary. It is structurally consistent, because:

##### (1) The earliest historical meaning of “Right”

In the history of political thought, the core of “Right” is not “conservatism”, but:

- limiting political power  
- recognizing that some things cannot be decided by politics  
- recognizing natural order, a priori constraints, and boundary conditions

In this sense, “rights are natural, a priori, and not rewritable” belongs naturally to the genealogy of “Right”.

##### (2) Naturalizing rights vs politicizing rights

In this model:

Z+ (rights as natural) implies:

- politics cannot define who “has more rights”  
- group identity cannot alter the ontology of rights  
- rights are higher-order constraints on political power

Z− (rights as constructed) implies:

- rights can be reallocated to achieve goals  
- rights can be asymmetrically configured based on history, structure, or identity  
- rights become political instruments

This corresponds to:

- Right → “limit politics’ capacity to define rights”  
- Left → “reconstruct the rights structure through politics”

##### (3) A shared meta-disagreement behind the three axes’ Left/Right labels

Across the three axes, the underlying meta-disagreement is:

**Does political power have the authority to define, allocate, and rewrite basic human standing?**  
**Is political power the “starting point”, or only a “tool within boundaries”?**

- Economic Order Axis:  
  - Right (+): property and exchange are prior to political arrangement  
  - Left (−): resource allocation is decided by the collective/politics

- Liberty Boundary Axis:  
  - Right (+): political power has clear external boundaries  
  - Left (−): boundaries can be expanded, centralized, and breached for goals

- Rights Ontology Axis:  
  - Right (+): rights are prior to politics; politics can only recognize them  
  - Left (−): rights are constructed/allocated/revised by politics and society

So, across axes:

**The “Right” side treats politics not as origin, but as an executor within constraints.**  
**The “Left” side treats politics as origin, or at least as a rewriter.**

Labeling “rights are natural, a priori, universal, symmetric” as Right (+) is therefore not semantic inheritance or ideological inertia. It is an unpacking of the same deep logic that also structures the Economic Order Axis and the Liberty Boundary Axis: whether political power is treated as the origin, or as a constrained tool. The Rights Ontology Axis does not repeat existing Left/Right labels; it reconstructs their upstream premise.

##### (4) A more intuitive framing: default subject in “individual–collective” relations

You can also grasp the Left/Right consistency across axes with a more intuitive question: in this kind of dispute, who is treated as the **default subject**?

- Left (−) more easily treats the **collective** as the default subject: first fix collective goals and plans, then define boundaries and rules accordingly.  
- Right (+) more easily treats the **individual** as the default subject: first fix individual-level boundary conditions, then coordinate within those boundaries.

Across the three axes, this mapping is homomorphic:

- X Economic Order Axis: collective decides resource organization and distribution (Left) vs individual property and exchange form the starting point (Right)  
- Y Liberty Boundary Axis: expand coercion boundaries in the name of collective goals (Left) vs constrain coercion by prioritizing individual action space (Right)  
- Z Rights Ontology Axis: rights can be constructed and rewritten by politics/society (Left) vs rights are prior to politics and can only be recognized and protected (Right)

Minimal scenario:

When a public goal (e.g., security, equality, public health) conflicts with an individual claim, the dispute is often not “is the goal good”, but “who is the default subject”. Do we allow collective goals to rewrite boundaries (more left), or do we treat individual boundaries as higher-order constraints (more right)?

#### 3.5 Sub-axes: where rights disputes branch

The Rights Ontology Axis can be operationalized through a set of highly stable Sub-axes. These are not independent coordinates; they are recurring branching patterns of the Rights Ontology Axis across issues:

| Category | Variables (Left − vs Right +) |
| :------: | :---------------------------- |
| Overall | rights are constructed vs rights are natural |
| Rights-status sub-axis | Institutional Rights vs Natural Rights<br>legal positivism vs natural law |
| Rights–institution relation sub-axis | rights derive from the state/society vs rights are prior to the state and society |
| Rights-structure sub-axis | structurally tilted rights vs universally symmetric rights<br>equity vs equality |
| Rights-holder sub-axis | group/identity rights prioritized vs individual rights prioritized<br>personhood can be redefined vs personhood objectively exists |
| Category-boundary sub-axis | gender as identity declaration vs gender as biological fact<br>(core: category assignment and “membership rules” for rights-holders) |
| Life and moral-community boundary sub-axis | fetus lacks personhood (or conditionally has) vs fetus has personhood<br>whether rights-holders can extend to animals vs anthropocentrism<br>allow euthanasia vs prohibit euthanasia |
| Environmental and intergenerational rights sub-axis | whether Environmental Rights / Rights of Nature hold vs environment is only a policy goal or resource constraint<br>whether Future Generations’ Rights hold (as a rights boundary on the present) vs future interests are policy considerations (not rights) |
| Responsibility-attribution sub-axis | responsibility is structuralized/historicized vs responsibility is individualized<br>moral judgment by position (strong/weak) vs moral judgment by behavior |

#### 3.6 State boundaries: not part of rights ontology, but part of institutional realization

Does a strict Natural Rights position allow “state–citizen boundaries” to enter the ontological layer of rights? If it does, does that mean “rights can be defined by the state”? If it does not, why do real institutions almost everywhere distinguish citizens from non-citizens?

Put plainly: citizens’ rights are usually treated as different from non-citizens’ rights. Does this mean we admit “rights can be defined by the state”?

**A strict Natural Rights position must be universalist at the ontological level. It cannot take the state or nation as a premise.**

At the same time, **a Natural Rights position can—and must—allow state boundaries at the level of conditions of exercise, responsibility structure, and institutional realization.**

The key distinction is:

- whether a right “exists” → an ontological question  
- how a right is “exercised / protected / realized; how responsibility is allocated” → an institutional question

Natural Rights are triggered by being human, not by being “a citizen of country X”, “a member of nation Y”, or “recognized by a particular state”.

#### 3.7 Understanding rights: ontology, institutional realization, and membership rights

This is not a legal definition of “rights”. It disentangles three kinds of questions that are often mixed together: what counts as basic rights as a human being, what belongs to institutional realization, and what is fundamentally membership politics. After separating them, positioning on the Rights Ontology Axis becomes much clearer.

##### (1) Layer 1: ontology of rights

At the ontological layer, state boundaries cannot enter the criteria; otherwise it is not Natural Rights. The question is: “do you have this right?”

Examples:

- right to life  
- bodily integrity  
- freedom of thought, conscience, and religion  
- not being subject to arbitrary violence, arbitrary detention, or torture  
- basic property rights (note: “basic”)  

##### (2) Layer 2: institutional realization

The existence of Natural Rights does not require institutional recognition, but their concrete practice requires institutional realization. The question is: “who protects this right, with what resources, through what institutions?”

As institutional duty-bearers, states can only—and can only prioritize—responsibility to their own members, via courts, taxation, and enforcement systems.

This is why citizens and non-citizens are distinguished here:

- it is not “non-citizens have no rights”;  
- it is “I do not bear the same institutional obligations to you.”  

This is a responsibility-boundary question.

##### (3) Layer 3: Political Membership Rights

This layer asks: “who participates in deciding the community’s rules?”

Examples: voting rights, eligibility for office, referendum participation. These rights:

- are not Natural Rights in the first place; they are typical institutional and political rights built on membership;  
- are instrumental rights for collective self-governance, not “rights one has as a human being”.

So, distinguishing citizens from non-citizens is not only reasonable here; it is unavoidable.

Putting these three layers back into the Z axis yields stable conclusions:

- If one claims “non-citizens can be arbitrarily deprived of life, detained, or abused here” → Z− (denying Natural Rights).  
- If one claims “non-citizens do not have this country’s voting rights, welfare entitlements, or public-resource quotas” → a boundary of institutional responsibility compatible with Natural Rights; could be Z+ or Z−, or may not trigger Z-axis analysis at all.  
- If one claims “some groups naturally have more/less basic rights because of identity” → explicit rights constructionism, Z−.

> A Natural Rights stance does not require the state to bear equal institutional responsibility to all people in the world. It requires only that the state not deny any person’s basic rights as a human being.

#### 3.8 Realization paths: why “universalist slogans” can still land on Z−

This section is not about whether a right “should exist today”. It is about how, even under the same claim of “universal rights / basic human rights”, realization paths can push the rights premise in different directions and thereby diverge on the Z axis.

##### (1) How the Rights Ontology Axis explains the left’s pursuit of universal equal human rights

The left often claims “everyone is equal” or “universal emancipation”, which can point toward universal rights and individual liberty. But in real disputes, it is sometimes pursued through the institutional construction of group-defined rights and coercive tools, using an “oppressor/oppressed” frame to drive confrontation. This creates a tension: universalist language, but institutional construction and asymmetric configuration in structure.

It becomes clearer with two minimal scenarios:

- **Scenario A: demands fall on prohibitive boundaries (closer to Z+)**  
  For example: “no one should be subject to arbitrary violence, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, or exclusion from basic human protection because of gender/sexual orientation.” This treats rights as prior boundaries; institutions mainly recognize, protect, and provide remedies.

- **Scenario B: demands fall on institutional definition and duty allocation (closer to Z−)**  
  For example: demanding that institutions first define new rights content, scope, and others’ duties (including what counts as infringement, which expressions or refusals count as illegal/violative, and what sanctions accompany them), and configuring rights and obligations asymmetrically by group identity to achieve outcome equality. In this structure, rights no longer appear as “universally symmetric pre-political boundaries”, but as institutionally constructed and adjustable arrangements.

Therefore, “claiming universal human rights” does not automatically imply Z+. When the argument hands the validity of rights to institutional definition and allows political goals to justify asymmetric configuration of rights, it should be recorded as Z− even if it still uses words like “innate”, “inborn”, or “universal”.

##### (2) How the Rights Ontology Axis analyzes revolutions

Revolution and struggle do not directly determine the Z position. The Z axis asks: during conflict and transformation, do participants still understand “basic rights / human rights” as a boundary above politics that holds symmetrically for all persons, or do they believe politics can redefine rights for goals and thereby decide who can be excluded from basic protection?

Many “rights-named” revolutions differ less by speed or intensity than by how they handle this boundary. Institutional reform can be radical; as long as rights themselves are not handed to political rewriting, the premise can remain closer to Z+. Conversely, even if a revolution self-identifies with “human rights”, if it cancels or reallocates basic rights on the basis of political opposition, it moves closer to Z−. Two classic cases illustrate this.

##### (3) The Glorious Revolution (England)

One key feature of the Glorious Revolution is that it limited monarchical power and established parliament and rule of law, turning rights into enforceable institutional arrangements. It less often framed political conflict as permanent enemy identities, and less often advanced reform by presupposing that “some types of people no longer deserve basic rights”.

On the Z axis, it is closer to this structure:

- Rights are understood as universal individual boundaries (e.g., property rights, procedural protections, freedom of speech and religion), and reform aims to make these boundaries more stable and predictable.  
- Institutional change is treated as a path of recognition and protection: constitutions, courts, and parliamentary mechanisms turn abstract rights into justiciable rights.  
- Even amid conflict and power transitions, it tries not to hand “whether basic rights still apply to opponents” to political decision.

So, the Glorious Revolution can serve as an example: change can be sharp, but if it treats institutions as the carrier of rights rather than rights as the spoils of political struggle, its rights-ontology premise can remain closer to Z+.

##### (4) The French Revolution

The French Revolution took different forms across phases, but under the Jacobins a typical tendency was to divide the political community into opposing identities such as “revolutionary / counter-revolutionary”, and to decide who could enjoy or temporarily lose basic protection accordingly, while also using strong mobilization and coercion to restructure order.

On the Z axis, this is closer to another structure:

- The rights boundary is no longer treated as a pre-political prohibitive floor, but as something the revolutionary process can redraw.  
- In practice, “who counts as a rights-holder and whose rights can be exceptioned” depends on political stance and camp classification rather than symmetric validity for all persons.  
- Institutions and coercion are used to constitute a new rights boundary, not merely to execute an existing boundary.

This revolutionary form is closer to Z− not because it is “more radical”, but because it treats rights themselves as adjustable variables in political struggle and allows political opposition to determine whether rights hold.

##### (5) Realization mode as a criterion on the Rights Ontology Axis

Compressed into one sentence: the Z axis does not use “is it revolutionary / is it radical” as a criterion. It uses the rights premise behind the realization mode. Three questions are practical checks:

- Is the rights boundary understood as a prior boundary, or must institutions define its content and scope first?  
- In conflict, do basic rights still hold symmetrically for all persons, or can they be exceptioned/asymmetrically configured by identity/camp?  
- Do institutions recognize and protect a boundary, or do they constitute and rewrite the boundary itself?

##### (6) The fundamental logic of Z+ (closing the procedure)

This one-sentence compression does not replace the procedure. It clarifies what must be jointly satisfied, structurally, when a position is judged as Z+:

> Recognize a set of basic rights that transcend politics, are universal and symmetric, and then realize them through concrete political and legal frameworks—without allowing those political means to redefine, create, or cancel the rights themselves.

Key points:

- basic rights are believed to exist prior to politics and law; they apply universally and are not redefined by political change;  
- in practice, they need concrete laws and institutions for protection and realization;  
- those political and legal means must not reverse-define “who deserves rights” or whether rights still hold symmetrically for all persons.

#### 3.9 A positioning procedure for the Rights Ontology Axis: making “realization mode” part of the main criterion

The Z axis asks whether a rights claim is understood as a prior boundary, or as something largely constructed, granted, and adjusted by institutions. Positioning should examine both the argument’s language and whether its realization must rely on institutions to “constitute” the boundary and duties.

##### Step 1: identify the object

Clarify what the dispute is “about”, not “which right” it is about. The object usually falls into one of three types:

- **qualification**: e.g., voting eligibility, citizenship, membership status  
- **boundary**: e.g., allowed vs prohibited; what counts as infringement  
- **obligation**: e.g., must vs must-not; whether consequences must be borne

At this step, the Z axis makes no judgment; it only positions the analytic object.

##### Step 2: extract the overriding justification

Compress the support/opposition rationale into one sentence:

> “It must be so because ______.”

Then judge the level of that reason:

- If it is an institutional reason—e.g., institutional design, policy effects, implementation mode, governance costs, proportionality as a method—without the assertion “politics must not veto it”  
  → the Z axis is not triggered; record as **Z0**.

- If it is an upstream reason—e.g., personhood, life, dignity, basic human rights, political equality, public responsibility, collective self-determination, non-negotiable bottom lines  
  → proceed to Step 3.

##### Step 3: judge whether it is truly a prior boundary that politics cannot veto

This is the core criterion of the Z axis. Judge both how it is said and how it is realized.

###### 3A. Argument language: does it claim “politics can only recognize, not define or cancel”?

If the reason is framed as:

- it holds even if current law disagrees  
- politics can only recognize it, not define or cancel it  
- it binds politics as a constraint

→ tends toward **Z+**.

If it is framed as:

- its content and scope must be determined through law/rules/institutions  
- it is an arrangement that the community can adjust, allocate, or negotiate  
- it explicitly admits that politics has the authority to define its boundary

→ tends toward **Z−**.

###### 3B. Realization structure: three observable criteria (same level as 3A)

Many disputes use words like “innate/universal/human rights”, but realization structure reveals the rights premise. The following are not “secondary checks”. They are the same criteria used to judge whether 3A truly holds:

- **Boundary source**: must the rights boundary rely on institutional rules to be “constituted” (content, triggers, what counts as infringement, consequences), or can it conceptually hold independently with institutions only executing it?  
- **Symmetry**: do basic rights hold symmetrically for all persons, or can they be exceptioned/asymmetrically configured by identity, camp, or political stance?  
- **Institutional role**: do institutions recognize and protect an existing boundary, or do they constitute and rewrite the boundary itself?

##### A common misclassification: “claims fundamental human rights”, yet still Z−

Why do some movements self-identify as human-rights movements but still land closer to the left side (Z−) on the Z axis? The key is not the slogan. It is the structural criterion: do they treat rights as a pre-political bottom line, or do they hand rights to institutions to define and redistribute?

**Z+ is not determined by “claiming priority to politics”. It is determined by whether the rights boundary is truly independent of institutional definition.**

Therefore, as long as an argument hands the validity of rights to institutions at any key point, it should be recorded as **Z−** even if it is called “fundamental human rights”:

- the **content** of the rights boundary must be specified by institutional rules (e.g., what counts as infringement; what expressions count as violations)  
- the **trigger conditions or scope** of obligations depend on specific institutional relations (e.g., organizational membership, employment relations, platform rules)  
- **infringement judgment and consequences** require institutional adjudication to “constitute” the boundary rather than merely to execute an existing boundary

In these cases, rights do not appear as pre-political prohibitive floors. They appear as **institutionally constructed norms**.  
→ record as **Z−**.

#### 3.10 Case analysis: self-identified pronouns and Z-axis positioning (following the procedure)

Consider the claim: in schools/companies/platforms, others have an obligation to use a person’s self-identified pronouns/titles; refusal should be defined as an infringement of their “basic rights/human rights” and should trigger institutional sanctions (discipline, bans, termination, etc.).

**Layer 1: surface right**

“I have a right to require you to address me with my designated pronouns.”  
→ the Z axis does not judge at this layer.

**Layer 2: supporting right**

“Because this is my dignity / basic human rights / right to exist.”  
→ the Z axis is triggered for attention, but still does not judge.

**Layer 3: rights-ontology premise (corresponding to Step 3)**

Is “dignity/human rights” understood as:

- (A) a pre-political boundary with content independent of institutions, or  
- (B) a norm whose content, scope, and enforcement mode must be defined by institutions?

In the pronoun case, regardless of how it is declared, the argument structure falls into (B):

- what the pronoun is → requires rules  
- when it counts as violation → requires rules  
- whether there are exceptions → requires rules  
- consequences of violation → requires rules

Moreover, rights that are prior to politics tend to share a structure: they are mostly **prohibitive rights**. They require others “not to do certain things”, drawing negative boundaries; others can avoid infringement by restraint alone. That is why they can be understood as existing prior to politics. The pronoun case is closer to a **prescriptive right**: it requires you to say certain things, adopt a particular symbolic system, and continuously update it to match the person’s self-definition of category. Rights that require others to take specific, ongoing, changeable positive actions are hard to hold independently prior to political order.

So, here dignity is treated as something that can be specified by institutions and turned into positive directives toward others.  
→ this claim sits on the left side of the Z axis (**Z−**).

Even if a claim is called a “natural right”, if its validity must rely on institutions to determine its specific content, subjects, and others’ duties, then on the Rights Ontology Axis its premise remains institutional-constructional and lacks an ontological status independent of political order.

#### 3.11 What risks can the extreme right side (Z+) create? (why Z+ can also become unbalanced)

The extreme risk of Z+ is not “oppression”, but “incapacity”: not tyranny, but paralysis.

##### (1) Risk 1: rights freezing

If “rights prior to politics” is understood as:

- rights are absolute  
- rights are non-tradeoffable  
- conflicts between rights admit no adjudication  
- any political intervention is usurpation

then one problem arises: the real world is conflictual, but rights are treated as untouchable metaphysical entities. The result is that, institutionally, conflicts such as:

- freedom of speech vs reputation  
- property rights vs public security  
- freedom of movement vs infectious-disease control  
- freedom of religion vs minors’ protection

cannot be adjudicated.

This is not “rights being violated”. It is the rights system losing operational capacity: a “normative-vacuum incapacity”. The typical consequence is not tyranny, but:

- law cannot cope  
- case law fragments (no unified framework for rights conflicts, hence unstable expectations)  
- rights are privately enforced (when institutional adjudication loses legitimacy, people find legal routes unstable and institutions avoid clear stances, so rights shift to non-institutional enforcement paths: media, capital, violence)

##### (2) Risk 2: institutional free-riding

If Z+ is pushed to an extreme, it can generate a seemingly noble but dangerous logic:

- rights exist naturally  
- the state is only a “gatekeeper”  
- the less state, the better

The problem is:

> rights may not depend on institutions to exist,  
> but their stable, symmetric, and predictable realization depends heavily on institutions.

Extreme Z+ tends to underestimate:

1. enforcement costs  
2. information asymmetries  
3. the seriousness of monopoly on violence

The result is:

- rights “naturally exist” in the hands of the strong  
- the weak’s rights “exist formally but fail in reality”  
- private orders (capital, gangs, public opinion) fill the state vacuum

This is not “returning to Natural Rights”. It is returning to pre-modern inequality of rights.

Extreme Z+ does not eliminate politics. It drives politics out of public institutions and hands it to private actors with the most resources.

##### (3) Risk 3: rights fundamentalism

As the Z axis moves toward an extreme far right, a posture appears that seems “more liberal than liberalism”:

- any public value is suspicious  
- any common goal is oppression  
- any collective narrative is a threat

This leads to:

- collapse of the concept of public interest  
- inability of the community to sustain itself  
- intergenerational responsibility and public risks left unassumed

Extreme Z+ can end up denying:

- the legitimacy of the state  
- the existence of public obligations  
- the necessity of institutional sacrifices

This is an anti-political liberalism that tends logically toward:

- anarchization  
- social atomization  
- normative fragmentation

Metaphysical absolutization of rights dissolves the political community.

#### 3.12 The risk curve on the Z axis

##### (1) Overview

- The risk at the far left of Z: rights are swallowed by politics; rights are denied in the name of politics.  
- The risk at the far right of Z: politics is hollowed out by rights; politics is denied in the name of rights.  
- The “golden interval” / “stable interval” of Z (Constrained Z+, e.g., Z = +2):  
  - rights are prior to politics in ontology  
  - institutions are indispensable in practice  
  - institutions can only recognize, protect, and coordinate rights; they cannot redefine who deserves rights  
  - rights conflicts are recognized and adjudicated  
  - an irreversible but governable tension balance is built between “rights prior to politics” and “institutional operability”

##### (2) High-risk zone on the far left of Z: rights politicization

Features:

- rights are defined by politics, identity, class, and historical narratives  
- rights can be granted, canceled, or frozen  
- groups can be excluded from “rights-holders”

Institutional consequences:

- asymmetric rights  
- oppressor/oppressed framing  
- revolution, purges, permanent struggle

Typical examples:

- Jacobin Terror  
- communist class dictatorship  
- contemporary radical identity politics

##### (3) Stable low-risk zone of Z: rights prior to politics + institutional realization

Criteria:

- rights are ontologically prior to politics, universal, and symmetric  
- law and the state only recognize, protect, and coordinate  
- institutions cannot reverse-define “who deserves rights”  
- rights conflicts are adjudicated through procedures and proportionality

A classic proportionality test (common in German/French systems, EU human-rights law, many constitutional courts) has four steps:

1. Legitimate Aim: is the interference for a legitimate public purpose?  
2. Suitability: does the measure help achieve that aim?  
3. Necessity: is there a less rights-infringing but equally effective alternative?  
4. Proportionality stricto sensu: is the rights harm clearly greater than the public benefit?

Key point: proportionality does not deny rights’ prior-to-politics status. It admits that real conflicts between rights exist and must be coordinated procedurally.

Typical examples:

- British constitutional liberalism  
- founding-era American understandings of rights

##### (4) High-risk zone on the far right of Z: rights absolutism

Features:

- rights are non-tradeoffable and non-adjudicable  
- the state is treated as a natural threat  
- the concept of public interest collapses

Institutional consequences:

- governance incapacity  
- private power rises above public institutions (capital, public opinion, violence)  
- rights become factually unequal but cannot be corrected
