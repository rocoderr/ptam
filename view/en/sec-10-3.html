### 3. A coordinate system for comparative politics and historical narrative: making same-name labels comparable

Many political labels drift historically not because “people became better/worse”, but because one word is forced to carry conflicts at different levels: economic order disputes, coercion-boundary disputes, and rights-ontology disputes move together under one container word.

In comparative politics and historical narrative, the three-axis model helps answer: “what did this label mean at that time and place?”—by describing three axes in parallel:

- at that time, did the label mainly bind to an X direction, a Y direction, or a Z direction?  
- when it changes in another context: on which axis does the change occur, and which axis remains relatively stable?  
- are the main drivers changes of main axes, or is it that Overlay Variables reshaped expression and mobilization?

This makes it easier to see why two people both calling themselves “liberal” may only be close on one axis; and why a camp can split at “rights conflicts” or “normalization of emergency powers”.
