### 10. Shifting sex work from criminalization to legalization or decriminalization

#### 10.1 Initial Position: governance centered on criminalization and moral regulation

Under criminalized frameworks, sex work governance features:

- **Y:** high-intensity intervention via criminal or quasi-criminal means; enforcement is front-loaded; punishment and suppression are main modes (Y−).  
- **Z:** sex workers are often not treated as full rights-holders; personal safety, labor rights, and health保障 sit at the margins of practice.  
- **X:** sex work is pushed underground into a hidden, fragmented, high-risk informal economy.

The goal is suppression and exclusion rather than regulation and protection.

#### 10.2 Contextual Scenario: systemic risks created by undergrounding

This motion is proposed when:

- criminalization fails to eliminate demand and intensifies undergrounding;  
- sex workers face higher violence, exploitation, and health risks;  
- enforcement is selective and inconsistent; governance costs remain high.

The focus shifts to whether criminalization creates higher social risk rather than reducing risk.

#### 10.3 Motion Statement

**The state should remove sex work from the criminal punishment system and regulate through legalization or decriminalization, reducing underground risks and improving conditions for involved populations.**

The core is changing the basic institutional positioning of sex workers.

#### 10.4 Structural Consequences: coercion retreats; rights become explicit; markets are reshaped

- **Y:** criminal coercion retreats; enforcement shifts from suppression to regulation and protection (Y→+).  
- **Z:** sex workers are recognized as full subjects of personal and labor rights; safety and health needs gain institutional recognition (Z→+).  
- **X:** underground economy transitions into a governable legal/semi-legal market; tools shift from punishment to industry norms and public services.

The core meaning is reincluding a long-excluded social activity into an institutional frame that can govern, constrain, and protect.
