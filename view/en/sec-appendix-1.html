### 1. Terminology Quick Reference

This table is provided for quick reader reference: fixed Chinese–English renderings of key terms and their minimal meanings in this paper.

| Chinese (fixed) | English (fixed) | Type | One-sentence meaning (in this paper) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Political Triple-Axis Model | Political Triple-Axis Model | Method | The explanatory framework proposed here: it positions political differences by three symmetric ontological axes. |
| Multi-Axis Political Models | Multi-Axis Political Models | Method | A generic label for “using multiple axes to depict political positions” in the literature; used for comparison, not referring back to this model. |
| Economic Order Axis | Economic Order Axis | Axis | The organizing order of economic activity: how property, allocation, and distribution rules are arranged. |
| Liberty Boundary Axis | Liberty Boundary Axis | Axis | The boundary and attribution of public coercion: who can coerce whom, and where the boundary is drawn. |
| Rights Ontology Axis | Rights Ontology Axis | Axis | The root view of rights: rights as pre-political boundaries vs rights mainly institutionally constructed and adjustable. |
| Left / Negative Direction | Left / Negative Direction | Notation | Direction symbol on an axis: closer to the negative end on that axis; not moral valence or real-world camp. |
| Right / Positive Direction | Right / Positive Direction | Notation | Direction symbol on an axis: closer to the positive end on that axis; not moral valence or real-world camp. |
| Normalized Axis Scale (−5 to +5) | Normalized Axis Scale (−5 to +5) | Notation | A rough relative-position marker in writing; not a measurement scale. |
| Nolan Chart | Nolan Chart | Notation | A representative Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Model, used for comparison and boundary clarification. |
| Political Compass | Political Compass | Notation | Another representative Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Model, used for comparison and boundary clarification. |
| Explanatory Model / Framework | Explanatory Model / Framework | Method | Methodological positioning: explains structure and sources of difference; does not output normative “should” conclusions. |
| Non-Normative | Non-Normative | Method | Writing constraint: separate explanation from evaluation; do not write the model as a value court. |
| Overlay Variables | Overlay Variables | Overlay | Factors not placed into X/Y/Z coordinates: explain why the same three-axis structure appears differently across contexts. |
| Motion | Motion | Operation | A vetoable, executable institutional claim; once institutionalized, it produces identifiable drift on at least one axis. |
| Issue | Issue | Operation | Everyday “issue/problem” with broad meaning; not used here as the direct unit for axis positioning. |
| Variable | Variable | Method | A candidate factor for explaining differences (e.g., progressive/conservative pairs), to be tested as axis vs overlay variable. |
| Labels | Labels | Method | Naming shells for diffusion/mobilization; drift by context; not equivalent to main axes or overlay variables. |
| Projections | Projections | Method | Mapping three-dimensional space into one/two dimensions for narrative convenience, at the cost of information loss. |
| Cognitive Lens | Cognitive Lens | Method | A default framing/blame “entry” before debate, shaping how X/Y/Z arguments are organized; not counted as coordinates. |
| Basic Rights / Human Rights | Basic Rights / Human Rights | Rights-type | Rights claims used as “hard-to-veto boundaries” in public argument; this paper does not provide a normative list. |
| Natural Rights | Natural Rights | Rights-type | A rights view: rights exist prior to institutions; institutions recognize and protect. |
| Institutional Rights | Institutional Rights | Rights-type | A rights view: rights depend on institutional arrangement, legal recognition, and enforcement, and are adjustable. |
| Sub-axes (Operational Facets) | Sub-axes (Operational Facets) | Operation | Operational facets expanding a main axis into enumerable oppositions for positioning/comparison; not new ontological axes. |
| Capitalism | Capitalism | Method | A positioned object: a common economic-order type located on X; not an axis name here. |
| Socialism | Socialism | Method | A positioned object: a common economic-order type located on X; not an axis name here. |
| Anarchism | Anarchism | Method | A positioned object: a common political stance type located on X/Y/Z; not replacing any ontological axis. |
| Background Conditions | Background Conditions | Overlay | Deeper, long-run contextual constraints (media tech, historical memory, geopolitical security, etc.); explanatory only, not coordinates. |
| Ontological Independence | Ontological Independence | Method | A criterion: a candidate axis can stand alone logically without presupposing another axis. |
| Orthogonality | Orthogonality | Method | A criterion: two axes describe different root questions and cannot be reduced to or substituted for each other. |
| Structure-Generating Capacity | Structure-Generating Capacity | Method | A criterion: whether a candidate axis can stably generate repeatably identifiable structural differences. |
