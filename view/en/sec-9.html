## IX. Typical Motion Analysis

In the preceding chapters, this book has constructed the Political Triple-Axis Model and distinguished ontological axes, Overlay Variables, and Cognitive Lens, in order to describe structural differences in political positioning. But **politics does not stop at “positions”. It changes institutions through concrete claims.**

For that purpose, this chapter introduces **Motion** as the unit of analysis.

In this book’s context, “motion” does not mean any controversial topic in a loose sense. It is a strict analytical concept aligned with the use of “motion” in *Robert’s Rules of Order*.

**What is a Motion?**

In this book, a **Motion** is:

> a clear, specific, executable, vetoable institutional claim whose content points to an identifiable directional shift in political space.

So a motion has these features:

- it is an **assertive statement**, not a question or a value verdict;  
- it specifies **actors, institutional instruments, and adjustment targets**;  
- once adopted, it will shift at least one axis among X, Y, and Z.

In everyday language, people often say “issue”, “problem”, or “controversy”. This book does not deny their everyday usefulness. But for analysis, it uses the unified term **Motion** to avoid confusion over the unit of analysis. “Issue” may still appear contextually to refer to the substantive content of a motion.

**Why include a chapter of typical motion analysis?**

If political analysis stops at ideology labels or axis positioning, it can only answer “where different stances are”. But the more important questions in real politics are:

- what claims are being proposed;  
- where do these claims try to push institutions from and toward;  
- why do some drifts recur repeatedly while others remain marginal.

This chapter does not judge whether a motion is “right or wrong”. Its aim is:

> to treat politics as a process of continuous directional shifts in three-dimensional space, and to analyze the structural meaning and consequences of those shifts.

So this chapter uses **the drift induced by a motion** as the starting point, rather than value opposition or camp comparison.

**Unified structure for each section**

Each section follows the same structure:

1. **Initial Position**: the default axis positions before the motion is proposed.  
2. **Contextual Scenario**: the background conditions under which the motion is proposed.  
3. **Motion Statement**: a clear institutional claim stating the intended drift.  
4. **Structural Consequences**: stable axis changes and risks if institutionalized.

This structure aims to show that politics is not only abstract debate, but a set of **directional institutional claims** that can be proposed, opposed, passed, or vetoed.
