### 5. The Cold War: How Global Bipolarity Compressed Left–Right Semantics

Keywords: bloc politics, bipolar framing.

In many Cold War contexts, “Left / Right” became close to a shorthand for:

- the opposing labels of a “socialist bloc / capitalist bloc”;  
- simplified substitutes for a small set of highly visible issues such as planning vs markets.

As a result, many structural questions that should be analyzed separately (for example the boundary of coercive power, the ontological assumptions behind rights, and disputes over membership) were temporarily hidden, or were forced to be expressed as “camp affiliation”.

The core mechanism in Cold War semantics was to translate complex political disputes into a binary frame of “camp security and institutional choice”. In that frame, “Left / Right” often served as an internal shorthand for external alignment. It did not necessarily describe fine-grained differences in domestic institutional structure, but it could quickly indicate classification within the “socialism–capitalism” narrative. This compression improved communicability, but it also raised the probability of systematic misclassification: the same label could point to entirely different institutional bundles across societies.
