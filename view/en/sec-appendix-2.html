### 2. Clarifying Common Misunderstandings

This section answers a concrete question: when using the Political Triple-Axis Model, what are readers most likely to mistake it for—leading to distorted positioning and comparison.

For quick lookup, each item is written as “misunderstanding—clarification—minimal scenario”.

#### 1) Misunderstanding: the three axes are value judgments about political positions

- Misunderstanding: an axis is “more advanced/backward”, “more just/evil”, or the three axes can output “which side should be chosen”.  
- Clarification: this paper treats the axes as an **Explanatory Model / Framework**. It answers “what is the structure of disagreement and where does difference come from”, not “who is right”. “Left / Right” are direction symbols only.  
- Minimal scenario: two people both support the same welfare policy. One supports it because “rights are prior and the state must act within rights boundaries” (closer to Z+). The other supports it because “rights are Institutional Rights and can be redefined for correction” (closer to Z−). Same policy direction does not imply the same structural stance.

#### 2) Misunderstanding: the three axes are “policy checklist axes”

- Misunderstanding: treating concrete policies (tax hikes, gun control, speech limits, antitrust) as “standard questions” that directly locate an axis.  
- Clarification: ontological axes discuss higher-level structural questions. X asks who has the final say in organizing economic order; Y asks how public coercion boundaries are drawn and attributed; Z asks whether rights are prior boundaries or institutionally constructed. The same policy can be supported/opposed for different structural reasons.  
- Minimal scenario: both claim “antitrust”. One argues “to maintain competitive order and the operability of private-property systems” (can be closer to X+). Another argues “to reshape market structure via concentrated regulation and take redistribution responsibility” (can be closer to X−). Look at reasons and structure, not slogans.

#### 3) Misunderstanding: the Economic Order Axis is “capitalism vs socialism”

- Misunderstanding: using “Capitalism / Socialism” as axis names, or assuming self-identification locates the axis.  
- Clarification: in this paper, capitalism/socialism are positioned objects, not axes. X is a continuous spectrum of property arrangement, allocation mechanisms, and distribution rules. Many real systems are mixed economic orders (X0), not a binary.  
- Minimal scenario: a country allows private enterprise and market prices while doing large-scale redistribution via high taxes and public services. It may be closer to X+ on ownership/allocation but closer to X− on distribution and redistribution responsibility. Decompose elements by definition rather than one-cut labels.

#### 4) Misunderstanding: the Liberty Boundary Axis is only about “state size”; coercion comes only from the state

- Misunderstanding: reducing Y to “government size”, or assuming “if the state doesn’t act, liberty expands”.  
- Clarification: Y concerns **public coercion** boundaries and attribution. Coercion can come from quasi-public institutions, platform rules, industry organizations, workplace systems, and de facto sanction mechanisms. The key is not “whether coercion exists”, but “what it targets, under what name, by what procedures”, and whether refusal remains a recognized and protected option.  
- Minimal scenario: the law does not ban your view, but platforms uniformly remove it, employers uniformly fire you, industry associations uniformly expel you, with no appeal procedure. Even without direct state action, refusal costs can compress liberty boundaries (toward Y−).

#### 5) Misunderstanding: the Liberty Boundary Axis equals “democracy vs dictatorship”; democracy is naturally Y+

- Misunderstanding: treating institutional form (elections, multiparty) as the Y position directly.  
- Clarification: democracy/authoritarianism is about institutional form and power-generation mechanisms; Y is about how coercion boundaries are drawn and constrained. Democracies can expand coercion boundaries via law and social mechanisms (toward Y−), while authoritarian systems can allow non-intervention space in some domains (toward Y+ on some issues). Related but not identical.  
- Minimal scenario: two democracies: A normalizes emergency powers and expands surveillance with weak review; B has high thresholds, narrow authorization, and revocable constraints. Both are “democracies”, but Y structure differs.

#### 6) Misunderstanding: the Rights Ontology Axis is “culture war / identity-politics axis” or “moral conservative vs moral progressive”

- Misunderstanding: treating Z as a value vote on “which groups/lifestyles you approve”.  
- Clarification: Z concerns the **ontological status of rights**: rights as prior boundaries (Natural Rights, closer to Z+) vs rights as Institutional Rights (closer to Z−). It focuses on argument structure: how rights set institutional boundaries and how they are upgraded/downgraded, not a normative list.  
- Minimal scenario: on one issue, some argue “does the right exist and is it prior to institutions?” (Z); others argue “which rules should execute it and where are execution boundaries?” (Y). Mixing them miswrites “rights prior/not” into “tolerance”.

#### 7) Misunderstanding: Overlay Variables can be a fourth main axis, or nationalism is automatically “the Right”

- Misunderstanding: treating nationalism/internationalism, religion/secularization, Identity Politics, etc. as coordinates at the same level as X/Y/Z; or defaulting “nationalism is right-wing”.  
- Clarification: Overlay Variables explain why the same three-axis structure appears differently across contexts; they do not enter X/Y/Z coordinates. Nationalism can ally with different X/Y/Z combinations and cannot replace three-axis positioning.  
- Minimal scenario: two “nationalisms” both emphasize strong boundaries, but one demands state-led industry and redistribution (closer to X−), while another emphasizes private property and market order (closer to X+). Equating nationalism with “the Right” erases economic-order differences.

#### 8) Misunderstanding: the three axes can be summed into one “overall left–right score”

- Misunderstanding: treating the (−5 to +5) markers as a computable scale, doing weighted sums or distance metrics; or treating a two-dimensional projection as “the simplified truth”.  
- Clarification: the markers are rough writing aids, not equidistant, not cross-axis comparable, and not for calculation. Projections are narrative tools and lose information. To explain conflict sources, return to X/Y/Z decomposition.  
- Minimal scenario: two people are close on X and Y but opposite on Z. Summing into a “total score” erases the key disagreement (rights as boundary vs institutional product).

#### 9) Misunderstanding: axes are necessarily bundled; one axis position automatically implies the other two

- Misunderstanding: “pro-market implies pro-liberty”, “security implies anti-rights”, “Natural Rights implies anti-welfare”, etc.  
- Clarification: the three axes are same-level and irreducible. Common alliances and narrative bundles exist historically, but they are contextual outcomes, not structural necessities. Analysis should position by axis first, then explain bundling via Overlay Variables and Background Conditions.  
- Minimal scenario: among those closer to Z+ (Natural Rights), some argue minimal economic intervention (closer to X+), while others argue public systems guaranteeing minimum living conditions (X0 or closer to X−). Hold Z fixed first, then see where X branches.

#### 10) Misunderstanding: the model can directly predict elections, party alliances, and policy outcomes

- Misunderstanding: using three-axis points as a prediction tool for next policies or winning probabilities.  
- Clarification: this paper emphasizes boundaries of use: the model explains structure and sources of disagreement, not specific political-event prediction. Outcomes depend heavily on Background Conditions, Overlay Variables, organizational resources, and institutional constraints. The model provides a language for decomposition, not substitution for process analysis.  
- Minimal scenario: two parties are similar on X/Y/Z, but under different electoral systems, media structures, and geopolitical shocks they exhibit very different mobilization strategies and policy bundles. The model explains the structure of their disputes but does not replace political-process analysis.
