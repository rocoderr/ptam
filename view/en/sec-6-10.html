### 10. Libertarianism

Libertarianism here is treated as common right-libertarianism: it grounds political legitimacy in “coercion boundaries should shrink as much as possible” and “individual rights have strong prior boundaries”, and tends to return much social coordination to voluntary exchange and private arrangements.

To avoid confusion: Libertarianism here is not a debate about philosophical free will; it is about how political institutions should answer the X/Y/Z question types.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type: right-libertarianism)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: Strong Right (X+) (private property and market allocation prioritized; taxation, regulation, and redistribution are required to bear heavier burdens of justification)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Strong Right (Y+) (pushes state coercive tools toward a minimum; emphasizes procedural constraints and “coercion is disallowed by default”)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: Strong Right (Z+) (Self-Ownership and the Non-Aggression Principle form strong prior boundaries; the state’s function is understood as protecting boundaries rather than reshaping boundaries)  

**Structural core**

Its structural core is “reduce political problems to voluntary relations as much as possible”: what can be solved by contract should not be solved by public coercion; what individuals can bear should not be forcibly collectivized; what can be realized through exit/choice should not be realized through unified commands.

Minimal scenario: a government plans to ban a category of voluntary transactions “for the public good” (e.g., restricting voluntary exchange of a certain service). A typical libertarian response is not first to ask whether the service is “good”, but to ask whether public coercion has the right to criminalize it directly when no harm to others is involved.

**Rights Ontology Axis: which rights are placed behind strong prior boundaries**

- Property Rights and Contract Rights are often placed behind strong boundaries: expropriation, regulation, and redistribution require higher evidentiary thresholds and stronger procedural constraints.  
- Freedom of Speech Rights and Privacy Rights are more likely to be treated as a veto line against public coercion.  
- many positive rights claims (e.g., some welfare rights) are more likely to be treated as Institutional Rights; their expansion must justify the coercion source and burden allocation.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Isolationism / Internationalism  
  - pull mechanism: on foreign relations and war issues, libertarianism more readily splits internally; the same “anti-expansion” intuition may lead to anti-intervention, or to different evaluations of external threats.  
- Secular / Religious  
  - pull mechanism: on moral/custom issues, secularization more readily pushes disputes back to “permit it as long as it does not harm others”; religious tradition more readily demands that some public norms enter institutions, pulling Y back toward the midpoint/left.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

- Libertarianism is often equated directly with “economic right (X+)”, but its structural core concentrates more on Y/Z: it first opposes treating public coercion as a default tool, not merely supporting markets.  
- libertarianism often contains within-axis splits: on abortion, drugs, and sex work, disagreements often come from how rights-holders and harm boundaries are defined (a Z-axis question), not from X.  
- in crisis contexts (war, security threats, public health emergencies), libertarianism is more sensitive to expansion of emergency powers; such disputes typically appear as sharp Y-axis conflict rather than moral judgments about policy goals.
