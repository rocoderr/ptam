### 1. Minimal Definition of the Dilemma: Two Uses of One Label

In real-world debates, “Left / Right” usually serves two functions at the same time:

1. **Coordinate use**: describing positioning.  
2. **Label use**: dividing camps and serving mobilization.

This creates three direct consequences:

- The same “Left / Right” label is used to cover disagreements at multiple levels (authority, distribution, rights, culture).  
- Disagreements at different levels are compressed into “Left / Right on a single axis”.  
- Once the discussion enters a mobilization context, “Left / Right” is more likely to be moralized, which reduces its analytical comparability.

The “two uses” matter because they explain a common pattern: many disputes look like disputes about “are you Left or Right”, but are in fact disputes about “which camp do you belong to”. When camp labeling displaces structural analysis, the discussion degrades from “what kind of disagreement is this, and at what level” into “identity classification and emotional mobilization”. The Political Triple-Axis Model starts by separating the coordinate use from the label use, so that Left / Right can regain precision as an explanatory language.

The rest of this chapter follows historical phases to show how Left / Right semantics were stacked and rewritten step by step.
