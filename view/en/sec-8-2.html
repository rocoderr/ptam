### 2. Political-Community Boundary: Nationalism vs Internationalism

Nationalism is one of the concepts most easily mistaken for an “ontological stance” in contemporary political talk. In public discourse it is often directly equated with “the Right”, “conservatism”, “anti-liberty”, or “anti-globalization”. But in structural analysis, this equivalence does not hold.

The root reason is: **nationalism does not stably answer any of the three ontological-axis questions.** It neither directly specifies whether the economic order should be market-led or state-led, nor necessarily demands expansion or contraction of coercion boundaries, nor necessarily provides an answer on whether rights are pre-political or institutionally constructed. It has no stable coordinates, takes highly diverse forms, and can pull the three axes in different directions across different issues. In practice, the “nationalism” label often bundles together non-equivalent drivers and claims: sovereignty vs international rules, immigration and membership, trade and industrial policy, security and border governance, assimilation vs multiculturalism, and even specific conflicts and identity narratives. Once these are mixed together, one gets a pseudo-question like “is nationalism Left or Right?”—a question that cannot be answered and should not be asked.

Nationalism operates by **setting a narrative boundary for the political community**, thereby changing—issue by issue—the **direction of force**, the **speed of drift**, and the **landing interval** of X/Y/Z. For that reason, nationalism should be analyzed as an **Overlay Variable**, not as an independent axis.

This section first decomposes the common disputed issues that sit under the “nationalism” label, and then, for each issue, specifies the three-axis tendency (or drift direction and landing interval) and explains why. The focus is not “where nationalism sits on the three axes”, but “how nationalist narratives change three-axis forces and drift in concrete disputes”.

#### 2.1 Why “nationalism = the Right” is common but unreliable

In many public contexts, the reason nationalism is intuitively labeled “the Right” is often historical experience: “national mobilization” is remembered as correlated with some recurring combinations—stronger border governance (Y tightening leftward), stronger emphasis on membership (Z more stratified by membership), and a more sovereignty-first external posture. But that is a label projection from contingent historical packages, not a structural necessity.

- On X (Economic Order Axis), nationalism does not presuppose that allocation must be state-led. It can coexist with a market economy and remain within X+ if it only introduces boundary- or rule-level interventions. But under a mobilization economy or industrial-security narrative, it can push the state toward outcome-determining allocation, drifting leftward along X and even entering X−.
- On Y (Liberty Boundary Axis), nationalism can exist as symbolic sovereignty talk without expanding coercive tools, landing near Y0. But when coupled with security, border governance, or emergency politics, it often legitimizes expanded administrative discretion and coercive power, tightening Y markedly leftward.
- On Z (Rights Ontology Axis), nationalism does not necessarily deny the pre-political status of individual basic rights. It may still treat basic rights as inviolable (near Z+ / Z0). But by emphasizing membership and community boundaries, it can also produce institutionalized, conditionalized, and stratified rights structures, generating more complex shifts on Z.

So treating nationalism as “the Right” is not a structural conclusion. It is a contingent historical combination mistaken as a general law.

#### 2.2 What “nationalism vs internationalism” overlays: boundary narratives

Nationalism and internationalism do not form a left–right axis. They are two ways of understanding **the boundary of the political community**:

- **Nationalism** tends to treat the political community as a bounded set with clear borders, with membership prioritized, and with sovereignty ranked above external rules. It repeatedly pushes “who belongs to us” and “who should be prioritized” to the front of political debates.
- **Internationalism** tends to treat the political community as an extendable structure, with rules potentially applicable across borders, and with obligations not fully conditioned on membership status.

These understandings do not directly yield policy answers. They work by **changing the narrative premise** of a question, reshuffling which issues matter more and how they exert force on X/Y/Z. Therefore, they can only be used as Overlay Variables and cannot replace the three ontological axes.

This is not a value judgment and not a coordinate classification in itself. The same person can be more nationalist on trade but more internationalist on war. The same party can be more nationalist on refugees but more internationalist on cross-border taxation or antitrust. Precisely because there is no stable positioning, this belongs to the overlay layer.

#### 2.3 Core disputed issues under the “nationalism” label and three-axis analysis

Each topic below is a dispute domain frequently labeled “nationalism” in real politics. The analytical focus is not the label itself, but how—under nationalist or internationalist narrative overlay—these issues produce concrete three-axis drift.

---

##### (1) Globalization and free trade vs tariff barriers and “country-first”

- On X, free trade and low tariffs mean that allocation is mainly market-driven, with markets expanding across borders; this stays closer to X+. Tariff barriers and trade wars reduce openness and competitive pressure through state means and lower predictability. Their effect is a drift toward X−. If intervention remains at the boundary/rule level, markets can still dominate and the landing interval can remain within X+. But if it escalates into state selection of industry outcomes—targeted subsidies, administrative allocation, forced reshoring, and other outcome-driven measures—it can cross X0 and enter X−.
- On Y, tariffs, sanctions, licensing, and review are often adjusted rapidly through administrative orders. They compress the refusal/exit space for firms and individuals in cross-border operation, investment, and planning, raising the cost of non-compliance. This typically tightens Y leftward (with landing depending on discretion intensity and remedies).
- On Z, free trade is usually not argued as a non-refusable pre-political right, so these disputes often do not directly touch rights ontology; Z tends to remain relatively stable.

##### (2) Trade wars, export controls, reshoring, and economic nationalism

- On X, these measures redraw market boundaries by the state and harm free markets to varying degrees. Economic nationalism almost necessarily implies a drift toward X−, but the key is the landing interval:
  - when the state redraws market boundaries through tariffs, quotas, or investment review, markets still allocate; landing often stays in X+;
  - when the state shapes outcomes via targeted subsidies, credit, and protection, X drifts further left toward X0;
  - when it becomes large-scale industrial subsidies, state-picked winners, “failure does not exit”, or direct state determination of capacity, prices, or allocation, it enters X−.
- On Y, administrative trade policy increases rule uncertainty and expands administrative discretion. It compresses refusal space for firms and individuals in cross-border trade, technology flows, and long-term planning. Nominally, firms still “choose”, but face concentrated coercive tools—licenses, sanctions, review, compliance—so Y usually tightens leftward. The compressed liberty space is concrete: cross-border transaction freedom, investment exit freedom, contractual expectations, and autonomy over capital and technology movement.
- On Z, if policy is treated as purely instrumental, effects on rights ontology are limited. But if justification shifts to “membership determines economic rights” and hardens into stratified rights (e.g., treating economic opportunity as a citizen-exclusive right), it can push Z toward stronger membership-based rights (often deeper into Z+ rather than Z−).

##### (3) International organizations and international rules (EU, UN, WTO)

- On Y, most existing international organizations operate in a “treaty—state execution” structure. They usually do not directly coerce individuals; states join voluntarily and implement domestically. In the strict sense, this is not “world-government coercion”, and internationalism is not equivalent to stronger coercion. International rules often constrain arbitrary state coercion and lock in policy space, potentially expanding predictable action space for individuals and firms. In that sense, international rules do not necessarily push Y leftward; in some domains they can buffer a Y− drift and even function as a Y+-direction “de-coercion”. But if a future international authority could bypass states and directly tax, enforce, or sanction individuals, it would introduce a higher-level coercive power and would push Y toward Y− significantly.

  This distinction is crucial. Nationalist narratives often oppose international organizations under the banner of “taking back sovereignty”, weakening international rules as “external constraint” or “external coercion”. Then state discretion rises, rules become less predictable, and for domestic actors this often appears as a leftward tightening on Y. But external constraint does not automatically mean stronger coercion; it can reduce state discretion and thus reduce arbitrariness in domestic coercion.

##### (4) Immigration, borders, and illegal immigration: how the national boundary appears on Y

- On Y, strengthened border enforcement, expanded detention and deportation, and restrictions on work and residence permits expand the scope of coercive tools and compress liberty space around entry and life arrangements; Y shifts clearly leftward. Landing depends on procedural constraints, judicial remedies, and proportionality. The compressed liberty space is concrete: room to enter and reside, feasibility of work and life planning, and remedies against administrative decisions.
- On Z, the core dispute is whether rights depend on membership status and whether rights are treated as pre-political:
  - if rights are stratified by citizenship and non-citizen rights are institutionally restricted, rights are treated as institutionally granted; Z shifts rightward toward stronger membership-based structure;
  - if certain residence, non-refoulement, and family reunification rights are treated as non-derogable basic rights and refusal itself is treated as infringement, rights are elevated as pre-political constraints; Z shifts leftward and, in severe cases, enters Z−.

##### (5) Asylum and refugees

This is one of the sharpest contested domains on Z.

- If asylum/refugee admission is treated as an institutional right within a system, and the state is treated as in principle able to refuse and limit, then these are Institutional Rights; Z often lands in Z0 / Z+.
- If asylum is framed as a non-refusable basic right, with legality of entry not affecting rights status and with refusal itself treated as infringement, rights are elevated into pre-political constraints; Z shifts leftward and can enter Z−. One side elevates rights via pre-political language, yet cannot avoid defining eligibility via political–administrative language.

In contemporary contexts, because asylum has been heavily “human-rights-ized”, nationalism on this issue often operates as a pull that drags an already left-shifted Z back toward a rejectable institutional interval.

##### (6) Assimilation vs multiculturalism

The degree to which immigrants must assimilate into a cultural core is a common dispute, with the main axes being Y and Z.

- On Y, demanding strong assimilation (language, culture, values, and behavioral norms) and using law, welfare, education, or immigration status as coercive levers to shape behavior and identity expression tends to tighten Y leftward. If the requirement is only constitutional/legal compliance while allowing cultural diversity, coercion is lower and the position is closer to Y0 / Y+.
- On Z, if rights are explicitly bound to cultural or identity conditions and treated as products of membership status and stratifiable, rights become institutionally constructed and Z drifts toward institutionalization (more Z−). If rights are not revoked due to cultural difference and basic rights hold as long as laws are followed, it is closer to pre-political (or at least universalized) recognition of rights, i.e., closer to Z+.

##### (7) Does nationalism necessarily imply “country-first → sacrifice individuals → violate individual rights → economic left shift and stronger coercion”?

This chain can happen in reality, but it is not structurally necessary and must be decomposed.

- A country-first narrative can indeed legitimize Y− expansion (security, borders, mobilization, emergency powers);
- it can also provide reasons for X to drift leftward (industrial security and resource mobilization);
- whether it necessarily sacrifices individual rights depends on Z:
  - if individual rights are still treated as pre-political constraints (Z+ or Z0), country-first is at most a policy preference and need not cross rights boundaries;
  - only if rights are institutionally membership-ized and the state is permitted to rewrite rights boundaries in the name of community interest does a more systematic leftward shift on Z occur and couple with Y− and X−.

So the correct model conclusion is: nationalism provides a narrative channel for “sacrifice individuals—expand coercion—mobilize”, but whether it becomes rights rewriting and coercion expansion depends on coupling strength with other overlay variables such as securitism, populist mobilization, and emergency politics.

##### (8) Can nationalism vs internationalism be treated as a single “axis”: more international = left, more national = right?

As an Overlay Variable, it can form a continuous spectrum of “community-boundary preference”, but it should not replace the three axes. The reason is that it cannot stably map onto directions on X/Y/Z:

- more international is not necessarily more X− (internationalism can be free trade, i.e., X+);
- more national is not necessarily more X− (economic nationalism can be boundary trimming within X+);
- more international is not necessarily more Y− (international rules can constrain arbitrary state coercion);
- more national is not necessarily more Y− (it can be symbolic sovereignty talk without expansion of coercion).

So it can be used as an intensity scale within the overlay layer, but not as a left–right deciding axis. A more adequate writing method is: nationalism/internationalism sets the “community-boundary narrative”, and then on each concrete issue we observe the drift direction and landing interval on X/Y/Z.

##### (9) Zionism and nationalism: coupling of nation, religion, and state

Many disputes about Zionism are, at root, community-boundary narratives about national self-determination and state security.

- On Y, it often couples with security priority, border governance, and military coercion (toward Y−).
- On Z, it often couples with membership status, the Law of Return, settlement rights, and membership-ized rights (pushing Z toward stronger membership-based structure).
- On X, left drift is not necessary; it depends on economic institutional arrangements and the degree of state intervention.

More importantly, external conflict and security narratives easily bind nationalism to emergency politics, accelerating the speed of drift toward Y−. This explains why some nationalisms are moderate in peacetime but deform quickly in conflict. This is still overlay-variable logic: not “nationalism is coercive in essence”, but “it more easily couples with securitism and pushes Y−”.

#### 2.4 Intensity tiers of nationalism and typical three-axis paths

| Intensity tier | Key features | X | Y | Z |
| :--: | :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Mild nationalism | symbolic sovereignty; cultural identity | X+ | Y0 | Z+ |
| Moderate nationalism | trade protection; border governance | toward X− (still within X+) | toward Y− | Z0 |
| Aggressive nationalism | mobilization economy; security-first | entering X− | clearly Y− | toward Z− |

#### 2.5 Driving mechanisms: why the same “nationalism” label can pull axes differently

Once decomposed, at least four common drivers appear under the nationalism label, corresponding to different axis drifts:

- **Security and border driver (most likely to push Y−)**  
  When nationalism couples with public order, borders, counterterrorism, and war risk, expansion of coercive tools is legitimized; Y tightens leftward. Landing depends on whether emergency power is procedurally constrained and judicially reviewable.

- **Industry and mobilization driver (pushes X leftward, often accelerates)**  
  When nationalism couples with industrial security, supply chains, and employment anxiety, state intervention can escalate from rule-level (still within X+) to outcome-determining (near or within X−). This escalation is usually continuous rather than a single jump.

- **Membership and rights stratification driver (triggers Z divergence)**  
  On immigration, asylum/refugees, and assimilation/multiculturalism, nationalism often binds rights to membership, pushing Z toward “institutional grant / stronger membership structure”. By contrast, internationalism’s “human-rights-izing” tendency elevates some rights into pre-political constraints, pushing Z leftward and even into Z−.

- **Rules and sovereignty driver (often misread on Y)**  
  International rules are not equivalent to world-government coercion. In many cross-border economic contexts, rules constrain arbitrary state intervention and increase predictability. “Taking back sovereignty” can mean rising state discretion, lower predictability, and thus a compressed liberty boundary for domestic actors (Y leftward). This is counterintuitive but crucial for understanding why “anti-globalization” is not necessarily “more liberty”.

#### 2.6 Section summary: what is gained by restoring nationalism to the overlay layer

If nationalism is treated as an ontological stance, it gets stuck in a loop of “is it Left or Right”. If it is restored to the overlay layer, its complexity becomes analyzable and decidable:

- on trade and industry, it typically appears as a leftward drift on X (with different degrees, landing from X+ to X−) and tightening on Y (rising administrative discretion and exit costs);
- on immigration and asylum/refugees, it often pushes membership-ized rights and collides directly with internationalism’s human-rights-izing narrative on Z (Z leftward elevation into pre-political rights vs Z rightward pullback into institutional grant and rejectability);
- on international rules, it is often misread as “anti-coercion”, but can mean rising state discretion and rule uncertainty, thus compressing the liberty boundary for domestic actors.

Across different issues, it pulls **X drift**, **Y tightening**, and **Z contestation** in different ways. This is why nationalism is not an axis, not a stable policy stance, and not a single-issue driver, but a label-like narrative container.

Only by decomposing it into concrete issues and returning each to three-axis analysis can nationalism’s complexity in contemporary politics shift from an emotional label into a **comparable, positionable, and explainable structural phenomenon**.
