### 5. Socialism

In this chapter, Socialism refers to an ideal type whose economic-order core is “stronger public organization, planning/directive coordination, and redistributive goals”. It is not identical to any single country’s concrete system.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: closer to the left (X−) (public/common arrangements matter more; allocation relies more on centralized decision or stronger public coordination)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: can range from midpoint to left (Y0/Y−) (depending on whether the governance path emphasizes procedural constraints and revocability of power)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: closer to the left (Z−) (more likely to treat rights as Institutional Rights and allow adjustment of rights with social goals)  

**Structural core**

Socialism’s most stable structural core is on the X axis: it treats the economy as an order that must be “organized”, not merely an outcome of spontaneous market coordination; therefore it tends to write distributive justice and risk sharing into the economic order itself.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Social Security Rights and Labor Rights are more likely to undergo Rights Escalation into institutional boundaries “not easily vetoed”.  
- Property Rights and Contract Rights are more likely to be treated as Institutional Rights whose boundaries are adjusted by public goals.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Revolution / Reform  
  - pull mechanism: revolutionary paths tend to pull Y leftward (toward Y−); reform paths are more likely to remain near the midpoint (Y0).  
- Populism / Elitism  
  - pull mechanism: populist mobilization more readily bundles redistribution with expansion of coercion boundaries; elite governance tends to limit Y expansion through procedural tools.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- industrialization and concentration of the “social question”: industrial transformation and large-scale labor–capital conflict often push X leftward and strengthen legitimacy for redistribution.  
- organized unions and party systems: institutionalized representation structures make it easier to stabilize Y near the midpoint (Y0).  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

The most typical internal split within Socialism comes from Y: with the same left-leaning X (X−), some emphasize procedure and liberty boundaries (Y0), while others are more tolerant of coercive expansion in the name of goals and order (Y−). In public semantics, “Socialism = authoritarianism” is usually a mistake of taking specific historical forms as the whole.
