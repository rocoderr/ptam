### 2. Comparison Table: Classical Ideologies on the Three Axes

For quick comparison, this section compresses all ideologies in this chapter into one table. The scores are only relative position marks—indicating “closer to which end”—and do not constitute a scale or measurement.

| Ideology | Economic Order Axis (X) | Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) | Rights Ontology Axis (Z) | Main overlay influences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Capitalism | Strong Right (+3): private property and market allocation prioritized | Not necessary; commonly neutral to right (0–+2) | Not necessary; commonly neutral to right (0–+2) | Nationalism / Internationalism; Religion / Secularization |
| Socialism | Strong Left (−3): public ownership/strong public coordination and redistribution prioritized | Not necessary; commonly neutral to left (0–−2) | Left (−2): more often appeals to Institutional Rights | Nationalism / Internationalism; Revolution / Reform |
| Anarchism | Left (−2): de-statized voluntary cooperation; communes/mutual aid | Far Right (+4): opposes the state monopoly on coercion; emphasizes autonomy | Not necessary; clear internal splits (−2 to +3): Natural Rights and Institutional Rights both appear | Revolution / Reform; Social Engineering / Spontaneous Order |
| Communism | Far Left (−4): centralized planning/public ownership | Far Left (−4): coercion boundaries expand sharply | Far Left (−4): rights are highly institutionalized | Revolution / Reform; Internationalism / Nationalism |
| Social Democracy | Slight Left to Neutral (−1 to 0): mixed economy | Neutral (0): procedural constraints on coercion | Neutral (0): prior boundaries + institutional rights coexist | Change / Stability; Populism / Elitism |
| Democratic Socialism | Left to Strong Left (−2 to −3): stronger public ownership and redistribution | Neutral (0): emphasizes procedure and revocability | Slight Left to Neutral (−1 to 0): leans institutional-construction | Revolution / Reform; Populism / Elitism |
| Communitarianism | Neutral (0): economic order is not the main axis | Slight Left to Left (−1 to −2): community order prioritized | Slight Left to Left (−1 to −2): rights embedded in community | Religion / Secularization; Assimilationism / Multiculturalism |
| Liberalism | Not necessary; commonly neutral to right (0–+2) | Right to Strong Right (+2 to +3): liberty prioritized | Right to Strong Right (+2 to +3): leans toward Natural Rights | Nationalism / Internationalism; Secular / Religious |
| Libertarianism | Strong Right (+3): private property/market allocation prioritized | Far Right (+4): shrink public coercion boundaries as much as possible | Far Right (+4): Self-Ownership and the Non-Aggression Principle (Natural Rights) | Secular / Religious; Isolationism / Internationalism |
| Neoliberalism | Strong Right (+3): marketization/deregulation | Not necessary; commonly neutral to right (0–+2) | Right (+2): contract/property prioritized | Free Trade / Protectionism; Internationalism / Nationalism |
| Conservatism | Right (+2): market-led order and private property prioritized | Right (+2): coercion boundaries shrink; limited government | Right (+2): stronger prior boundaries for rights | Religion / Secularization; Change / Stability |
| Fascism | Neutral to Left (0–−2): Instrumentalized Market | Far Left (−4): order and mobilization prioritized | Far Left (−4): rights subordinated to the community | Nationalism / Internationalism; Centralization or Totalitarianism / Democratic Checks and Balances |
| Nazism | Neutral to Left (0–−2): Instrumentalized Market | Far Left (−4): totalitarian coercion | Far Left (−4): rights-holders are rewritten | Nationalism / Internationalism; Centralization or Totalitarianism / Democratic Checks and Balances |
