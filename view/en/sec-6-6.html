### 6. Democratic Socialism

Democratic Socialism is usually closer to the socialist end on X, but emphasizes restructuring economic order through democratic procedures; therefore on Y it emphasizes political competition and revocability of power.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: closer to the left (X−) (leans toward public ownership and stronger economic organization)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: commonly the midpoint (Y0) (emphasizes procedure, competition, and authorization boundaries)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: closer to left-to-midpoint (Z−/Z0) (emphasizes institutional construction and historical evolution of rights, but can acknowledge some prior boundaries)  

**Structural core**

The structural core of Democratic Socialism is “X-left + Y-midpoint”: use democratic procedures to reconstruct economic order toward public goals, while preserving revocability of power and the legitimacy of opposition.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Social Security Rights and Labor Rights are more likely to be treated as basic rights and bundled with Equality Rights.  
- Property Rights are usually treated as Institutional Rights; boundaries can be reset for public goals, but procedural constraints are emphasized.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Revolution / Reform  
  - pull mechanism: reform paths emphasize “reconstruction within procedure”, keeping Y at the midpoint; rising revolutionary narratives push Y leftward.  
- Populism / Elitism  
  - pull mechanism: populist mobilization can bundle “economic left” with “anti-procedure”; elite governance tends to stabilize Y through procedural tools.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- stability of constitutional and electoral institutions: the more stable institutions are, the more sustainable Y-midpoint becomes; with instability, leftward slippage risk rises.  
- economic crises and fiscal capacity: crises and fiscal constraints increase incentives for “rapid reconstruction”, enlarging Y volatility.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

The main risk point is not whether it is left on X (X−), but whether it can stably maintain Y at the midpoint (Y0). Under crisis mobilization and polarization, the midpoint often shifts leftward, and its distance from more general socialist/communist forms can shrink quickly.
