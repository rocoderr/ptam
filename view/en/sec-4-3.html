### 3. Why Overlay Variables Should Not Be Treated as Main Axes or Sub-axes

Overlay Variables cannot be upgraded into main axes not because they are “less important”, but because they fail the structural requirements of a main axis. A main axis must point to an irreducible type of fundamental question and remain stably orthogonal to the other main axes. Overlay Variables typically cannot do this.

Why Overlay Variables cannot be main axes:

- **Insufficient ontological independence**: they are often attitudes, styles, or situation-bound orientations, and do not stably point to an irreducible type of fundamental question.  
- **Insufficient orthogonality**: they often depend on the combined state of X/Y/Z and cannot vary independently when the three-axis positioning is held fixed.  
- **Insufficient structural generativity**: they can reshape mobilization and policy bundles, but usually do not generate a new political order structure on their own.  
- **Insufficient cross-historical stability**: many oppositions are highly time-bound and do not recur across civilizations and historical stages as the same question-type.  

Overlay Variables should also not be treated as Sub-axes of a main axis. A Sub-axis is a domain-specific projection of one main axis and remains centered on the same fundamental question. Overlay Variables, however, often cut across axes: they can affect economic order, liberty boundaries, and rights ontology, so they cannot be stably placed “inside” one axis.
