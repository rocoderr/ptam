### 5. Independence and Irreducibility Between the Three Axes

To close this chapter, we need to clarify a commonly misread point: “orthogonality” of the three axes is not a promise that they are “never correlated” in reality. It is a distinction at the level of explanatory framework. The three axes answer three types of fundamental questions. Therefore, they cannot substitute for each other, and one axis cannot “explain away” the other two.

#### 5.1 What does each axis answer?

- **Economic Order Axis**: how are resources and factors of production organized, allocated, and distributed?  
- **Liberty Boundary Axis**: where does coercion stop; who can legitimately wield it; and by what procedures is it constrained?  
- **Rights Ontology Axis**: do rights hold prior to institutions; how are rights-holders defined; must rights structure be symmetric?

These three question-types are symmetric in abstraction: Order—Boundary—Ontology. This level consistency is precisely why they can stand side by side as ontological axes, rather than reducing one to a “value judgment” or an “added cultural axis”.

#### 5.2 Why can no two axes imply the third?

- Economic Order vs Liberty Boundary: resource allocation certainly involves coercion, but “who allocates resources” and “who can coerce whom” are different objects. History and reality contain many mixed combinations such as “market-leaning economically but coercive in governance”, or “strong state coordination economically but strongly constrained procedurally in governance”.  
- Liberty Boundary vs Rights Ontology: the coercion boundary asks “can coercion be used, and how far”; rights ontology asks “what kind of rights coercion is supposed to protect or reshape, and on what ontological basis”. The same coercion-boundary stance can be supported by different rights-ontology assumptions, and vice versa.  
- Economic Order vs Rights Ontology: issues such as property rights can trigger both axes, but “how property is arranged” and “whether rights are prior to institutions” are different levels. Reducing rights-ontology disputes to economic left–right loses explanatory power for many contemporary rights disputes.

#### 5.3 Does overlap among Sub-axes break the three axes?

You may notice that tensions such as “procedural justice vs substantive results” and “individual vs group” appear repeatedly across different axes’ Sub-axes. This does not mean the main axes fail. The reason is:

- main axes distinguish “fundamental question types”; Sub-axes present “projections of the same tension onto different objects”;  
- people do not separate their value intuitions into three non-overlapping systems, so cross-axis correlations often appear empirically;  
- the model’s goal is not to eliminate entanglement, but to locate it: are we discussing resource organization, coercion boundaries, or rights ontology?

#### 5.4 An analogy

Think of political dispute as passing through three parallel “gates”—three dispute entrances. The first gate concerns economic order (how resources are organized). The second concerns liberty boundaries (where coercion stops). The third concerns rights ontology (where rights come from, and for whom). Phenomena such as “same words with different meanings”, “splits within the same camp”, and “cross-camp alliances” often arise not because people are insufficiently rational, but because they are disputing at different gates while being forced into one line by the same “Left / Right” label.

When a gate is “closed”, that type of issue is treated as default background (not discussed, or treated as irrelevant). When a gate is “open”, that type of issue is recognized as part of the dispute and must be explicitly positioned on the axis. Multiple gates can be triggered by the same issue, but analysis should avoid mixing different gates’ questions arbitrarily. Many disputes that look like “value mismatch” are upstream disputes about “whether to open a gate” rather than about policy details—because many arguments are stuck further upstream: the two sides have not aligned on what type of question they are disputing, or on the default premise at a gate (especially the Rights Ontology Axis). Only after rerouting can we avoid forcibly compressing different axes into the same “Left / Right” line.

What the Political Triple-Axis Model does is to separate these three gates again. After separation, disputes can occur at clearer and more comparable positions: what type of question are we discussing? Are we arguing on the same axis, or are we actually talking past each other across different axes?
