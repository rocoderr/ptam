## II. Problem Background

“Left / Right” is one of the most common—and most distortion-prone—classification labels in modern politics. Its conceptual dilemma is not mainly caused by individual misunderstanding. It is mainly caused by semantic migration in conceptual history: the same words were used, in different periods, to point to conflicts at different levels, and were later compressed and spliced together through mass communication and mobilization.

This chapter addresses one concrete question: why “Left / Right” came to denote different kinds of disagreements in different historical phases, and why it now shows strong cross-context drift in contemporary debates. Only after we make the chain of semantic migration clear does the later distinction between three ontological axes and Overlay Variables become necessary in a precise way.

**Timeline (quick view)**

- 1789: legitimacy of estates vs legal equality (parliamentary semantics)  
- the 19th century: class, distribution, and property enter the center (economic issues rise)  
- early 20th century: mass mobilization and extreme experiences (camp semantics rise)  
- the Cold War: global bipolarity compresses meaning (camp labeling)  
- the post–Cold War era: issue expansion (nation, culture, identity, environment are “stuffed into Left / Right”)  

Reading note: none of these phases is the “final version” of what Left / Right means. Each phase added a new semantic load onto the label. The key historical fact is not which phase was “correct”, but that these loads were retained and stacked. As a result, “Left / Right” came to carry multiple layers of conflict that are not naturally isomorphic.
