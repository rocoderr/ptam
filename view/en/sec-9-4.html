### 4. Trading higher social order for stronger policing and harsher punishment

#### 4.1 Initial Position: criminal governance with priority on procedural constraints

In rule-of-law frameworks emphasizing procedural justice, criminal governance has long rested on strong constraints on state coercion:

- **Y:** enforcement powers are strictly authorized and procedurally constrained; policing follows minimal-necessity; coercion is overall rear-guard (Y+).  
- **Z:** defendants’ and citizens’ rights are treated as pre-political; procedural guarantees (presumption of innocence, due process) are core constraints on state power (Z+).  
- **X:** public order and punishment resource allocation is constrained by fiscal limits and proportionality; state-capacity expansion is not default.

Legitimacy comes more from procedural completeness than from enforcement intensity.

#### 4.2 Contextual Scenario: rising crime and accumulated order anxiety

This motion is often proposed when:

- crime rises or is widely perceived to rise;  
- dissatisfaction accumulates that enforcement is “too lenient” or “too slow”;  
- high-salience cases trigger collective anxiety about loss of control.

The focus shifts from “should procedure be followed” to whether stronger enforcement/punishment should be prioritized to restore deterrence and order.

#### 4.3 Motion Statement

**When public order is judged persistently deteriorating, the state should expand policing authority, raise punishment severity, and lower enforcement-intervention thresholds, trading for higher social order and deterrence.**

The core is re-ordering the priority between procedural safeguards and order goals.

#### 4.4 Structural Consequences: coercion expands; procedural boundaries recede

- **Y:** coercion moves forward; policing expands from post-hoc or clear-suspicion stages into preventive, broad enforcement (Y→−).  
- **Z:** procedural rights shift from inviolable pre-political boundaries into compressible institutional guarantees under order goals (Z→−).  
- **X:** spending on public order and punishment rises; enforcement-system expansion becomes a long-term fiscal and institutional arrangement.

The essence is trading expanded state coercion for more certain order output.
