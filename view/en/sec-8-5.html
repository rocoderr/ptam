### 5. Non-state Enforcement of Norms: Political Correctness

Political Correctness (PC) is defined here as a **non-state enforcement mechanism of norms**. It does not rely on law, courts, or formal state power. Instead, it manages the **boundary of sayability** in public and semi-public spaces through organizational norms, industry conventions, professional ethics, media contexts, and public-opinion consensus. As an Overlay Variable, PC does not provide stable three-axis coordinates, but under certain conditions it can persistently produce directional drifts on the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) and the Rights Ontology Axis (Z).

#### 5.1 Basic function: from interaction etiquette to normative boundaries

- In its lowest-intensity form, PC primarily exists as **interaction etiquette and professional norms**, aiming to reduce unnecessary offense, stigmatizing language, and stereotypical expression.  
  - At this level it is mostly discursive pressure; constraints on refusal space and expression liberty are limited, often remaining near Y0.
- When PC is systematically embedded into organizational codes, media standards, and academic/industry guidelines, it starts to function as **boundary governance**:  
  - certain expressions are labeled “improper”, “non-compliant”, “unacceptable”;  
  - the target of norms gradually expands from “how one speaks” to “the view itself”.  
  - then Y begins to shift leftward more clearly (often around Y−1 to Y−2), because expression is constrained not only by law but by institutionalized non-state norms.

#### 5.2 Structural impact on speech liberty (Y)

PC’s impact is not “whether criticism exists”. It is whether **refusal remains a recognized and protected option**:

- when individuals can still express disagreement at limited social cost, substantive space for speech liberty remains;  
- when “not using prescribed language” or “refusing a designated narrative” becomes framed as moral failure or professional risk, refusal becomes high-cost in practice and speech liberty is compressed—even if the law does not prohibit the expression.

The key is not whether motives are benevolent, but whether **expression risk is systematically raised**.

#### 5.3 Indirect erosion of procedural justice

PC does not directly negate procedural justice, but it often weakens procedural requirements through:

- **norm judgment preceding fact-finding:** once speech is deemed “out of bounds”, discussion often jumps into moral classification rather than factual verification and contextual analysis;  
- **blurred standards:** norm boundaries often rely on consensus and felt offense rather than enumerable, predictable rules, reducing foreseeability;  
- **weak correction mechanisms:** as a norm regime, PC often lacks clear appeal, review, and revision paths.

These do not amount to formal deprivation of procedure, but they make procedural justice **bypassed rather than openly denied**.

#### 5.4 Interface with Z (Rights Ontology Axis)

PC affects Z by shaping:

- which rights or dignities are treated as **non-offendable and non-questionable by default**;  
- whose feelings are treated as having higher normative priority.

When PC centers on protecting individuals from direct insult, its rights understanding is closer to universalist anti-discrimination, and Z tends to remain near Z0. When PC uses the “non-offendability” of specific identity categories as the normative baseline, rights interpretation becomes more dependent on institutionalization and group consensus, and Z more easily drifts leftward (around Z−1 and below).
