### 7. Identity Mobilization and Rights-Structure Recomposition: Identity Politics

In this framework, Identity Politics is strictly defined as an **overlay-layer method of political mobilization and legitimacy organization**. It does not first answer “which policies should be adopted”. It answers a more upstream question: **who can, in what capacity, raise rights claims that bind institutions, others, and public decisions**. For that reason, its most central and most divisive effects occur less on X and more on the Rights Ontology Axis (Z), often coupled tightly with governance tools on the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y).

#### 7.1 Basic structure: from “individual rights” to “category legitimacy”

In classical liberal/constitutional contexts, rights claims often follow this structure:

- the basic rights-holder is the **individual**;  
- rights are understood as **prior to institutions**, and institutions are tasked with recognition, protection, and remedy;  
- identity differences enter institutional thinking mainly as **possible discrimination risk**, not as constitutive elements of rights ontology.

Identity Politics introduces a structural shift:

- rights claims are raised less as “I as an individual” and more as “I as a member of an identity category”;  
- identity categories shift from mere risk variables into **sources of legitimacy**;  
- rights shift from boundaries constraining institutions into reasons **for rewriting institutional structures**.

This is a starting point for Z drifting from the midpoint (Z0) toward Z−.

#### 7.2 Z conflict (I): recomposing the rights-holder

##### (1) Individuals as rights-holders (Z0 to Z+)

- the basic carrier of rights is a distinguishable individual;  
- institutions must treat individuals symmetrically; differentiation requires procedurally contestable justification;  
- identity categories do not have independent rights-holder status.

Even when anti-discrimination is strongly emphasized, this stance maintains **symmetry and universalizability** of rights.

##### (2) Identity categories as rights-holders (around Z−1 to Z−2)

- rights can be asserted by the **category as a whole**;  
- individual actions are evaluated as embedded in group structure;  
- rights can be granted and restricted via category-differentiated institutional design.

Here rights are no longer only boundaries protecting individuals from violation. They become **institutional tools for correcting structural inequality**—a common Z-leftward path under Identity Politics.

#### 7.3 Z conflict (II): the ontological status of identity categories

##### (1) Identity as discovered fact (Z0)

- categories are treated as descriptive social-experience facts;  
- institutions may acknowledge difference without making strong ontological/normative commitments;  
- rights structure does not automatically change with categories.

##### (2) Identity as institutionally constructible and revisable (Z−1 and below)

- categories are institutionally defined, expanded, or dynamically adjusted;  
- new categories can directly trigger rights upgrades;  
- category boundaries themselves become core objects of political contestation.

At this stage the key Z change is: **rights no longer require a stable subject as a prerequisite**; rights can be recomposed in parallel with category recomposition. This increases plasticity while reducing stability.

#### 7.4 Z conflict (III): conversion and upgrading of rights types

Identity Politics does not only demand anti-discrimination rights; it often pushes a structural conversion of rights types:

- **anti-discrimination rights:**  
  - aim to prevent adverse treatment based on identity;  
  - still take individuals as rights-holders;  
  - tend to sit near Z0.
- **identity/group rights:**  
  - rights are directly bound to identity categories;  
  - institutions must proactively recognize and respond to difference;  
  - Z drifts toward Z−.
- **compensatory/corrective rights:**  
  - rights are explicitly used to rewrite opportunity structure or outcome distribution;  
  - rights gain veto-like function against existing institutional arrangements;  
  - Z can drift further leftward (toward Z−2 or lower).

In this process, “rights upgrading” becomes a common strategy: negotiable policy goals are elevated into basic rights that are hard to veto, changing the level of institutional discussion.

#### 7.5 Lived experience: structural change in evidence rules

A highly consequential but often underestimated mechanism in Identity Politics is the evidentiary status shift of **lived experience**:

- when lived experience is granted priority legitimacy, first-person accounts are often treated as “non-refutable”;  
- fact-checking, causal analysis, and procedural evidence are treated as “secondary” or “insensitive”;  
- rebuttal itself can be reinterpreted as harm or oppression.

This is not merely emotional appeal. It directly affects Z: **the legitimacy source of rights shifts from publicly testable argumentation toward non-falsifiable subjective experience**.

#### 7.6 Coupling with Y (Liberty Boundary Axis)

When Z claims under Identity Politics enter the implementation layer, governance tools are often required:

- imposing consequences on non-compliance, non-recognition, or questioning;  
- redefining refusal as harm or illegitimate behavior;  
- compressing real space for expression and refusal.

So Identity Politics does not necessarily force Y leftward in principle. But in practice it often **couples** with Political Correctness and Cancel Culture:

- Z claims provide legitimacy;  
- Y tools cash out consequences.

#### 7.7 A crucial distinction: anti-discrimination ≠ all institutionalized forms of Identity Politics

This framework requires a clear distinction:

- supporting anti-discrimination rights is not automatically the same as supporting all institutionalized expressions of Identity Politics;  
- questioning certain rights structures of Identity Politics is not the same as denying historical injustice or present discrimination.

The real disagreement is not “do you care about the disadvantaged”. It is:

- whether rights are still understood as **boundaries of institutions**, or  
- whether rights have become **political tools that override institutions**.

This is exactly where the Rights Ontology Axis (Z) provides non-replaceable analytical value in contemporary conflict.
