### 1. Core Definition: A Three-Axis Ontological Model, Not a Multi-Axis Scale

The core claim of the Political Triple-Axis Model is that modern political disagreements contain three independent, mutually irreducible, and symmetric-in-abstraction ontological axes. Together they form a three-dimensional coordinate system—a three-dimensional political space—for positioning political stances and ideologies in order to identify where the fundamental disagreements lie.

The model also classifies additional variables as Overlay Variables for auxiliary analysis. These variables do not have the properties of ontological axes. Instead, they “overlay” political claims and can induce shifts or change how positions are expressed.

By distinguishing ontological axes from overlay variables, this model differs from Multi-Axis Political Models that stack indicators and dimensions into measurement- and scoring-centered scales. The method here is: regardless of the surface labels or policy bundles used in a dispute—whether “progressive vs conservative” or “national vs international”—first decompose the disagreement back into these three foundational questions, and only then proceed.

The model further distinguishes Background Conditions and Cognitive Lens. These are not typically analyzed as ideologies and are not counted as components of the model. They are used only to add background-level clarification in analysis.

This is an explanatory model/framework, not an evaluative tool. In this paper, “Left / Right” are used only as direction symbols (Left = −, Right = +). They are not tied to any country-specific camp meanings and do not carry value judgments.
