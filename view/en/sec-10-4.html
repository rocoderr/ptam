### 4. An organizational governance and institutional-analysis tool: decomposing conflict into “order / boundary / ontology”

In organizational governance and institutional analysis, the model is not to tell organizations “which side to choose”, but to describe the structural source of conflict: is it conflict over resources and distribution rules (X), over governance coercion boundaries (Y), or over whether rights can be institutionally rewritten (Z)?

**Minimal scenario: why one policy proposal triggers two different types of opposition**

Consider a minimal scenario: a platform introduces stronger content moderation and account penalties to reduce group harm and incitement.

- one type of opposition focuses on Y: where is the boundary of “who can coerce whom” between platform and state, and platform and users? which tools become normalized governance tools?  
- another type focuses on Z: are expression-related rights treated as pre-political boundaries (Z+), or as institutionally balanceable/rewritable/correctable (Z−)?

Two kinds of opposition do not necessarily mean opponents are inconsistent. A more common explanation is that they locate the root of conflict on different axes.
