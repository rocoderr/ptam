### 7. Overlay Variables and Their Relationship to the Main Axes

In addition to the three ontological axes, this model uses Overlay Variables for auxiliary analysis of political claims.

Overlay variables:

- may generate differences among political claims or stances, but cannot be elevated into independent ontological axes; and
- may themselves not generate differences in political claims or stances, yet still lead to different policy bundles, mobilization methods, and forms of public debate.

Overlay variables share these common features:

- they can form stable opposing positions in political discussion;
- they can serve as bases for political identity and camp division;
- they do not typically have stable three-axis positions of their own; and
- they do not raise new, irreducible foundational questions.

Overlay variables can explain:

- why political claims with similar three-axis positions show noticeable gaps; and
- why political claims with the same three-axis positions present different policy bundles, mobilization methods, and forms of public discussion across societies, periods, or contexts (e.g., public narrative language, agenda ordering, and styles of policy justification).

Overlay variables often appear as paired contrasts, for example:

- value and time orientation (emphasizing the speed, direction, and acceptable risk of institutional change): progressive vs conservative; radical vs moderate; revolution vs reform;
- identity and cultural-identification differences (emphasizing cultural boundaries and identity sources of the political community): national vs international; local vs global; secular vs religious;
- differences in mobilization and organizational forms (emphasizing the primary forms of political action): mass vs elite; street politics vs parliamentary negotiation.

In real politics, these contrasts often become the direct focal points of dispute and revolve around “who we are,” “whom we represent,” and “how we act,” and thus function as overlay variables at the level of political claims.

Overlay variables do not constitute new main axes because they do not pose new, irreducible foundational questions. However, in the development of concrete political claims, an overlay variable sometimes changes three-axis positioning and sometimes does not. Whether a change occurs must be judged through concrete institutional consequences: does the institution re-answer one of the following questions—how resources are organized, where public coercion ends, or whether rights are prior to institutions? Choices of language, mobilization methods, agenda ordering, or budget emphasis are not sufficient by themselves to constitute a change in three-axis positioning if they do not change those institutional answers.
