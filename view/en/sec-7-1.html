### 1. Wokeism

In this paper, Wokeism is treated as a **contemporary ideological form**, not a simple bundle of issues (LGBTQ, antiracism, feminism, etc.). Its core feature is not which groups it centers or which policies it proposes, but **how it systematically rewrites the ontological assumptions of rights, and then derives institutional obligations and justifications for public coercion from that rewrite**.

When a rights movement is no longer satisfied with equal protection within an existing rights framework, and instead claims that: an identity itself constitutes a non-refusable rights boundary; refusal to recognize is treated as a violation of basic rights or even human rights; and institutions, organizations, or platforms must bear ongoing compliance obligations—then it has crossed from an “issue” into an ideological form that can be stably positioned by the three-axis model.

This section does not judge whether Wokeism is “correct”. It analyzes its structural position on the Rights Ontology Axis and the Liberty Boundary Axis, and how it repeatedly generates similar political structures across issue domains through Rights Escalation and “consequence enforcement” mechanisms.

#### 1.1 When does a “rights issue” become an ideology?

Today, almost any social issue can be framed as a “rights” issue: someone is treated unfairly, ignored, or placed in a weak position. But this does not mean every rights claim is an ideology.

If a rights claim says only: “under existing laws and institutions, I should also be treated equally”, it is still **asking for a place within existing rules**. The controversy mainly concentrates on policy design, implementation bias, and cost–benefit tradeoffs.

Wokeism’s watershed appears here. When a rights claim is no longer satisfied with “equality within rules”, but further says:

- **an identity itself constitutes a rights boundary that cannot be refused**;  
- non-recognition, disagreement, or hesitation is treated as a violation of basic rights or human rights;  
- institutions, organizations, and platforms have an obligation to continuously comply, correct, and “take a side”;  

then it is no longer just an issue. It becomes a **reproducible political structure**—that is, an ideology.

In the three-axis model, this shift happens first on the **Rights Ontology Axis**: rights are no longer understood as “what institutions grant and protect”, but as **hard boundaries prior to institutions that constrain institutions in reverse**. This is the root reason Wokeism can diffuse across issues.

This also explains why “gay rights” cannot be equated directly with Wokeism. In its classic form, gay rights says: “I should not be treated differently because of sexual orientation.” That does not require rewriting rights ontology, so it does not constitute an ideology by itself. Only when it is rephrased as “identity itself is non-refusable” and begins to demand punitive responses to refusal does it enter a Wokeism-ized trajectory.

#### 1.2 On the three axes, where is Wokeism “left”?

Many people feel confused: Wokeism sometimes talks like “freedom”, sometimes like “control”; sometimes it talks like “rights”, sometimes like “discipline”. Under the three-axis model, the structure is clearer:

**First, Z (Rights Ontology Axis): Wokeism tends to move toward strong prior boundaries, but with identity as the generator.**  
The key move is: “identity position” becomes the source of rights legitimacy; the rights boundary is treated as non-refusable; refusal becomes rights violation. This is a strong Z-axis move: rights are treated as prior, veto-like boundaries—but the rights-holder boundary is generated and stabilized through identity framing.

**Second, Y (Liberty Boundary Axis): refusal space is treated as illegitimate, so coercion boundaries expand through enforcement mechanisms.**  
If refusal is redefined as rights violation, then constraining refusal is no longer framed as constraining liberty; it is framed as protecting rights. This pulls Y toward the left (Y−), often via non-state enforcement (organizations, platforms, professional communities).

**Third, X (Economic Order Axis): Wokeism itself is not stable.**  
On X, Wokeism does not have a fixed program. It sometimes supports redistribution; sometimes it asks mainly for “symbolic correction”; sometimes it criticizes capital; sometimes it operates through large organizations and platforms. This shows that economic claims are often **tools**, not the root.

#### 1.3 Why does Wokeism often “start where reasoning seems unclear”, yet remain powerful?

Wokeism’s power does not mainly come from sophisticated theory. It comes from a stable default way of seeing:

**the Oppressor–Oppressed Lens**.

Once this lens is adopted, the order of questions is rearranged: identity position first, behavior second; structure first, context second; “which side are you on” first, details second. Many disputes that could have been about costs and tradeoffs get locked early into “rights” disputes. Dissent is less treated as a different judgment, and more treated as “denying oppression” or “defending vested interests”.

This does not mean supporters are “illogical”. It means they are **entering the dispute through another entry structure**—and that entry structure most easily pushes issues onto the Rights Ontology Axis.

#### 1.4 How coercion appears: from Cancel Culture to quasi-coercive effects

Wokeism’s sharpest edge is not how intense its rhetoric is, but **how it enforces consequences**.

This requires mentioning Cancel Culture. Its key feature is not “insults”, but making refusal extremely costly in practice: platform bans, organizational disassociation, exclusion from professional networks, and stigmatizing labels that are hard to remove.

Often these actions are not performed directly by the state, but the effect becomes increasingly coercive: you “can disagree”, but you pay the price of losing a job, losing channels of speech, and losing social credit.

In the three-axis model, this means: on the Liberty Boundary Axis, coercion is no longer only state-originated; it is “distributedly enforced” through organizational rules, platform governance, and professional consensus. And the precondition for this non-state pressure to be legitimated is exactly the earlier move: **rights have been defined as non-refusable boundaries**. Once refusal is defined as “rights violation”, cancellation, banning, and exclusion are framed not as oppression, but as “self-defense” or “necessary correction”.

#### 1.5 How this section relates to the next four sections

Antiracism, feminism, gender politics, and anti-colonialism are not automatically equivalent to Wokeism. They take a Wokeism-ized form only when several conditions hold:

- whether rights are escalated into non-refusable identity boundaries;  
- whether refusal is systematically redefined as rights violation;  
- whether coercion is enforced through institutional, platform, or cultural mechanisms.  

The goal of the later sections is not to repeat value judgments, but to show: **how this structure is concretely implemented in different issues, and where it generates new tensions.**
