### 6. Post–Cold War: Issue Expansion and “Stuffing Left / Right”—Nation, Culture, Identity, and Environment in One Container

Keywords: issue expansion, label reuse.

After the Cold War, the external bipolar anchor weakened. But public issues expanded quickly, and “Left / Right” was reused as a low-cost classification container. A common pattern was to stuff many differences directly into Left / Right:

- **Nationalism / Internationalism**: often misused as a Left / Right marker.  
- **religion / secularism; tradition / progress**: often packaged as “cultural Left / Right”.  
- **identity politics, immigration, and border governance**: often trigger disputes about rights-holders and membership.  
- **environment and climate; technology and media structure**: often absorbed into moralized opposition narratives.  

Direct consequences include:

1. Same name, different meaning: in cross-country comparison, “the same Left / Right label” often points to different structures.  
2. Cross-cutting combinations: within a single society, positions often become mixed combinations such as “closer to the right on the Economic Order Axis (X+) but closer to the left on the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y−)”, or the reverse.  
3. Generalized extremization: “far left / far right” becomes easier to use as a mobilizing umbrella label, which weakens analytical precision.

After the Cold War, Left / Right did not disappear. Instead, it often continued as a general-purpose tool for public classification. The problem is that when external bipolar anchors weaken, issue sets expand, and alliance structures become more flexible, Left / Right labels often stop corresponding to a single dominant conflict and become a shortcut for bundling issues together. Nationalism, identity politics, environmental politics, and technology debates are repeatedly absorbed into the Left / Right frame, but the way they are absorbed is unstable across social conditions. This makes Left / Right mean different things across issues within the same country, and it produces frequent mismatch in cross-country comparison.
