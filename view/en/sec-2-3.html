### 3. The 19th Century: Industrialization and the “Social Question”—Class, Distribution, and Property Move Center Stage

Keywords: industrialization → the social question → class politics.

- **Main conflict**: labor–capital relations; distributive legitimacy; property rights and redistribution.  
- **“Left”** (typical): egalitarianism, labor movements, socialism, and redistribution claims.  
- **“Right”** (typical): priority of private property; defense of market order and existing social structures.  

In this period, Left / Right became frequently bound to economic issues. This created historical inertia for later simplifications that treat Left / Right as an “economic spectrum”. But the binding itself was still a result of contextual institutionalization, not a conceptual necessity.

This semantic shift is especially important. When economic issues became the most visible, most organizable, and most easily institutionalized conflicts for party competition, Left / Right began to be understood in everyday experience as “a disagreement about how the economy should be organized”. This is the historical background for why the Economic Order Axis becomes necessary later.
