### 1. Definition and Criteria for Overlay Variables

**Key features of Overlay Variables:**

- Overlay Variables themselves usually do not have a stable X/Y/Z positioning.  
- They can exert “positional pulls” on an ideology’s X/Y/Z positioning, creating shifts and divergence in political claims or political positions.  
- They may also not change positioning, but still change how a position *looks* in practice: the policy bundle it arrives with, the mobilization style it uses, and the shape of public discussion—for example, what story it tells, what labels it uses, which issue it fights first, whom it allies with, and what threat-perception or identity frame it acts under.  
- They can form stable opposing camps and become a basis for political identity and camp division.  
- They do not introduce a new irreducible type of fundamental question, so they cannot be elevated into an independent ontological axis—yet in contemporary discourse they are often misread as a “new axis”.

**Overlay Variables explain:**

- why political claims with similar (or nearby) three-axis positioning show observable positioning gaps;  
- why political claims with the same three-axis positioning, in different societies, stages, or situations, appear as different policy bundles, mobilization styles, and public-discussion forms.
