### 8. Communitarianism

In this chapter, Communitarianism refers to an ideal type whose core is “community relations and public responsibilities prioritized”. It stresses that individuals are not isolated atoms but embedded in concrete communities. It is neither nationalism nor necessarily identical to religious conservatism; it is a structural orientation centered on community persistence and social trust.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: commonly the midpoint (X0) (economic order is not the main axis, but markets and property are expected to submit to community rules)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: midpoint to left (Y0/Y−) (to maintain community order and responsibility structures, it tolerates some public coercion and normative governance)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: midpoint to left (Z0/Z−) (rights are more likely to be understood as arrangements embedded in community and institutions)  

**Structural core**

Its structural core is “community prior to the abstract individual”: it cares more about how social relations, responsibilities, and public trust are maintained, rather than grounding legitimacy entirely in prior boundaries of individual rights.  
Minimal scenario: a community sets public norms through schools, religious organizations, or professional associations; individual choices must coordinate with community responsibilities.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Membership-Based Rights and Group/Identity Rights are more likely to undergo Rights Escalation into part of the community boundary.  
- some individual liberty rights (expression, migration, lifestyle choice) are more likely to undergo Conditionalization of Rights, with boundaries depending on community norms and responsibility arrangements.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Religion / Secularization  
  - pull mechanism: when religious tradition strengthens, legitimacy of rights more readily appeals to community norms and traditional authority, and Y/Z are more likely to drift leftward; when secularization strengthens, institutional procedures constrain community norms more strongly.  
- Assimilationism / Multiculturalism  
  - pull mechanism: stronger assimilationism tightens membership and community boundaries, pushing Z more leftward; stronger multiculturalism more readily acknowledges multiple communities and returns toward the midpoint.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- weakening intermediary organizations and declining social trust: when local communities, trade associations, and civic organizations weaken, communitarian narratives more easily gain mobilization space.  
- high mobility and expanding immigration: as mobility and cultural differences grow, disputes about “community boundaries” are more likely to be amplified.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Communitarianism is often misread as “conservatism” or “nationalism”, but its core is not fixed historical tradition or statism; it is the priority of community relations and responsibilities. It can coexist with different X-axis combinations: it can pair with redistribution or with market order. Classifying it simply as “Left” or “Right” obscures its structural core.
