### 12. Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism can be understood as an ideal type that elevates market mechanisms into a broader governance principle and tends to limit direct state allocation of resources through rule-based constraints.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: Strong Right (X+) (marketization, deregulation, property and competition rules prioritized)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: commonly midpoint-to-right (Y0/Y+) (tends to limit direct intervention in economic domains, but can take different paths on security, immigration, and public order)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: commonly on the right (Z+) (emphasizes contract, property rights, and institutional boundaries)  

**Structural core**

Neoliberalism’s structural core is on X: it treats market allocation and competition rules as the primary organizing principle, and uses institutionalized rules to shrink the space for direct state allocation of resources.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Property Rights and Contract Rights are often treated as strong-boundary rights, close to a Natural Rights understanding.  
- Social Security Rights are more often treated as Institutional Rights; their boundaries and degree of expansion are adjusted with fiscal and efficiency evaluations.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Free Trade / Protectionism  
  - pull mechanism: stronger free trade more readily binds with cross-border market integration; rising protectionism reshapes X+ expression via national industrial policy.  
- Internationalism / Nationalism  
  - pull mechanism: stronger internationalism more readily shifts rule-making upward; stronger nationalism more readily makes market principles serve “country-first” narratives.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- high mobility of capital and technology: cross-border capital and platformized production increase feasibility of market coordination, strengthening X-right expression.  
- fiscal constraints and inflation pressure: fiscal tightening and inflation governance strengthen legitimacy of “rule-based limits on state allocation”.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Neoliberalism is often equated with “globalization”, but in this framework “globalization / country-first” belongs to the Overlay Variable layer. Its core is market principles on the X-right (X+), not a fixed geopolitical or nationalist stance.
