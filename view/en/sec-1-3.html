### 3. Expanded Descriptions of the Three Ontological Axes

The three ontological axes correspond to three types of foundational questions. Logically, they are orthogonal and non-substitutable. A single stance can point in different directions (+/−) across different axes. This is not a contradiction; political disagreement is multi-dimensional in structure.

#### 3.1 Economic Order Axis: How the economy is organized

It asks:

- Does the property arrangement lean toward public/common ownership (−) or private ownership (+)?
- Does decision authority (who decides production and exchange) lean toward centralized command (−) or decentralized price signals and market actors (+)?
- Are resources allocated mainly through markets (+) or through planning (−)?
- Are output and surplus distributed mainly by market returns (+), or by political/social objectives and redistribution (−)?

#### 3.2 Liberty Boundary Axis: Where the boundary of coercion lies

It asks:

- Does the boundary of coercion lean toward expansion—extending the reach of public coercion on the grounds of security and control (−)—or toward contraction—limiting the reach of public coercion on the grounds of liberty (+)?
- Who may coerce whom?

Here “liberty” means the space of action that coercion cannot reach. This axis describes how the coercion boundary is drawn and constrained; it is not judging good or bad. “Public coercion” is centered on state coercion, but also includes quasi-state coercion that is institutionalized under specific structural conditions and can, in effect, approximate state coercion.

To avoid confusion: liberty ≠ rights. The Liberty Boundary Axis concerns coercion boundaries. The ontological status of rights claims belongs to the Z Rights Ontology Axis.

#### 3.3 Rights Ontology Axis: Whether rights are treated as “prior boundaries” or “institutional products”

It asks:

- Are rights understood as pre-institutional boundaries (+), or as products of institutional construction (−)?
- Is the institution’s role closer to “discovering and recognizing” rights (+), or “constructing and granting” rights (−)?

This axis does not enumerate a rights checklist. It makes explicit the ontological basis of rights. It is a distinctive feature and one of the model’s primary innovations.

> A Natural Rights stance does not require a state to assume equal institutional obligations to everyone in the world.  
> It requires only that the state not deny anyone’s basic rights as a human being.  
> The former is a political and fiscal question; the latter is a rights-ontology question.

To avoid mistaking “rights slogans” for “rights ontology,” Chapter III provides a reusable decision procedure: first identify the object of dispute (Object), then extract the overriding justification (Overriding Justification), and finally test whether that justification truly constitutes a “prior boundary that politics may not veto” (including both the argumentative language and the institutional implementation structure). The same procedure is also used to discuss typical imbalance risks at the two ends of the Z axis: the far left is more prone to Rights Politicization, while the far right is more prone to Rights Absolutism.

As a more intuitive analogy: the three main axes are like three parallel “gates.” In the same issue, which gates are opened and which are treated as default background conditions often determines whether the dispute is about resource organization, coercion boundaries, or rights ontology. This is also one structural reason why “the same words with different meanings,” “fractures within the same camp,” and “cross-camp alliances” occur so frequently.
