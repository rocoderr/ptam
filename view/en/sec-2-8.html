### 8. Chapter Summary: Three Structural Causes of the Conceptual Dilemma

To consolidate the comparison above, the conceptual dilemma of Left–Right politics can be compressed into three structural causes:

1. **Layer stacking**: estates vs equality, class vs property, camp vs institutions, and culture vs identity are stacked into one label.  
2. **Context drift**: under different social conditions, Left / Right couples with concrete issues in different ways, which makes cross-context comparison unreliable.  
3. **Linear compression**: when Left / Right is treated as one linear coordinate, a multi-dimensional structure is forced into one dimension, and systematic misclassification follows.

The Political Triple-Axis Model is proposed in this context. It decomposes political disagreement into three symmetric ontological axes—Economic Order Axis, Liberty Boundary Axis, and Rights Ontology Axis—and shifts many situational differences such as nationalism and identity politics into the layer of Overlay Variables. This moves “Left / Right” from a mobilizing label back into a reusable explanatory language.

More specifically: the three axes answer “what kind of fundamental structural question the disagreement belongs to”, while Overlay Variables explain “why, in this historical context, that kind of disagreement appears with a certain label, narrative, and alliance structure”. Only by separating the two layers can we, without adding infinitely many “new axes”, explain both the historical deformation of Left / Right and the cross-context drift of contemporary political labels.

To make these three causes operational, we can use a coarse-grained comparison: in different historical phases, the types of conflict that entered the semantic center of Left / Right correspond roughly to different structural questions.

- The 1789 context: questions about how authority is justified and how political standing is defined (closer to the levels addressed by the Liberty Boundary Axis and the Rights Ontology Axis).  
- The 19th-century context: questions about how resources and property are organized (closer to the level addressed by the Economic Order Axis).  
- Early 20th century: questions about mobilization, rule, and coercive structures, made more salient under narratives such as nationalism (closer to the Liberty Boundary Axis intersecting with the Overlay Variables layer).  
- The Cold War and post–Cold War era: Overlay Variables become more important (security structures, communication structures, and identity and cultural narratives reshape how three-axis disagreements are expressed and how alliances form).  

The next chapter formally defines and expands the three ontological axes, and specifies each axis’s core question, directional meaning, and common boundaries of misclassification.
