## VIII. Overlay Variable Analysis

With the three ontological axes established, this chapter turns to several typical Overlay Variables that are highly active in real politics but cannot be placed directly on the three axes. They do not change a position’s basic location in three-dimensional space, but they can strongly shape its **operating mode**, **conflict patterns**, and **institutional consequences**.

This chapter does not present these phenomena as a flat list. It follows a **progressive analytical sequence**. Each type of overlay variable often provides conditions or an operating frame for the next.

The overall path is:

- start from **institutional form**: direct democracy and representative democracy do not carry an inherent left–right direction, but they change what can be voted on, whether rights can be put to vote, and how coercion gains legitimacy;  
- move to **political community and legitimacy narratives**: nationalism and internationalism define “who we are”; populism, elitism, and meritocracy define “who is qualified to represent legitimacy”; they shape the basic boundary and direction of political mobilization;  
- enter **norm boundaries and consequence-enforcement mechanisms**: political correctness draws norm boundaries; cancel culture turns norm deviation into enforceable consequences; this shows how coercion can stabilize in non-state forms and compress the liberty boundary;  
- go deeper into **identity and rights-structure interventions**: Identity Politics and DEI are no longer just mobilization methods; they intervene directly in rights structures, producing asymmetric upgrades, conditionalization, or institutionalization of rights;  
- close with a **synthetic case**: the Israel–Palestine conflict as a typical scene where multiple overlay variables stack and interact, amplifying each other within the same political space.

With this structure, the chapter aims to help readers distinguish two kinds of questions:

- where a political position is **located** structurally;  
- why it **happens in this particular way** in real politics.
