### 4. Gender Politics (Common in LGBTQ Contexts)

“Gender politics” here is not an empirical discussion of gender differences or the lived situation of sexual minorities. It refers to disputes over the ontological status of “gender” as a classification in politics and institutions. The core question is: is gender understood as a classification that can be treated as a reality basis acknowledged prior to politics and institutions, or is it understood mainly as an identity category that must be established through institutional recognition, rule-definition, and public enforcement?

In this sense, the controversy is no longer “equal protection”, but shifts upstream into rights ontology and institutional legitimacy: who has the authority to make gender determinations with public effect; whether such determinations bind others and institutions; and whether refusal to recognize remains a legitimate option. For this reason, gender politics becomes one of the most front-line—and most unstable—dispute zones on the Rights Ontology Axis.

Within this structure, gender self-identification is proposed as a principle of rights determination: an individual’s subjective self-identification should have priority effect in institutions and public interaction. Under this principle, different claims push institutional rewriting of gender categories along different paths: transgender claims often operate within the binary framework and emphasize recognition of category change; non-binary claims challenge the binary framework itself; and gender fluidity adds a time dimension and denies the persistence of gender categories. This section distinguishes these paths and analyzes their structural positions in the three-axis model, without making truth-value or moral judgments about individual experiences.

If the previous section’s feminism discusses **“how women as a group enter the rights structure”**, gender politics discusses a more fundamental and more unstable question:

**whether the gender category itself remains a basis that institutions and rights can rely on.**

This is why gender politics is one of the issue domains most likely to trigger high-intensity conflict and hardest to cool down in contemporary politics.

#### 4.1 From “sexual minority rights” to “the gender category itself”

Early discussions around sexual minorities were still largely familiar: discrimination, exclusion from existing institutions, and equal treatment without rewriting the ontology of rules.

The turning point of gender politics is that the dispute moves upstream:

- from “equal protection” to “who decides categories”;  
- from “rights within categories” to “what counts as a category”;  
- from “policy tradeoffs” to “refusal is (or is not) legitimate”.

Once category-definition is treated as a rights question, the refusal space becomes the frontline, and the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) is quickly triggered.

#### 4.2 Three paths: category change, category expansion, and category instability

To keep the debate analyzable, it helps to separate three common paths:

- **Transgender (category change within a binary frame)**: focuses on recognition of switching categories; the central disputes are institutional recognition procedures and boundary enforcement.  
- **Non-binary (category expansion beyond a binary frame)**: challenges the binary frame as such; disputes shift to how institutions can maintain adjudicable rules.  
- **Gender fluidity (category instability over time)**: adds temporal variability, challenging persistence of categories, thereby raising institutional adjudicability problems further.

Across these paths, the main structural fault line is Z: whether “gender” is treated as a pre-political basis that institutions recognize, or as an institutional category that must be continuously constructed and enforced.

#### 4.3 Why this issue easily “runs out of control” on Z

Once rights-holding and institutional obligations are tied to a category whose criteria cannot be stably adjudicated, two things happen:

- Z disputes escalate from “what rights apply” to “what counts as a rights-holder category”;  
- Y disputes intensify because enforcement mechanisms expand to compel recognition and penalize refusal.

This is why gender politics often becomes one of the most front-line and most volatile zones on the Rights Ontology Axis.
