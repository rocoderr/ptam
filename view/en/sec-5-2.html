### 2. Cognitive Lens

In real public discourse, people often do not enter policy details directly. A more common route is: first, through a default “way of seeing”, they decompose reality into interacting actors, and they pre-install an acceptable causal storyline for relations among these actors—what gets defined first as “the problem”, where the cause should be placed, how responsibility and legitimacy should be allocated, and what counts as key evidence. Only on that basis do they form intuitive judgments about coercion boundaries, rights structure, and economic legitimacy (that is, the model’s three main axes). To capture this in a reusable analytic language, this paper introduces the concept of the Cognitive Lens.

#### 2.1 Definition: what question does it answer?

A Cognitive Lens is an upstream cognitive “entry structure” that operates before concrete policy and institutional debates. It defines:

- **how the problem is defined**: which phenomena are treated first as “the problem” to be explained, thereby directing the entry toward different mechanisms (e.g., “inequality” can be read first as persistent structural domination, as incentive/constraint mismatch, as a manifestation of security dilemmas, or as a trace of backstage manipulation).  
- **how the actors are set**: are the primary actors individuals, identity groups, national communities, elite blocs, or “the people”? Different actor settings directly determine the skeleton of the causal narrative of “who constrains whom”.  
- **how causality is assigned and legitimated**: in a given causal narrative, is the cause placed mainly in individual behavior and procedure, in institutional rules and structural position (strong/weak), or in external threats and conflict relations? Accordingly, how are responsibility and legitimacy allocated (who is presumed credible; who is presumed to require correction or constraint)?  
- **what counts as relevant evidence**: which facts are seen first and treated as “key evidence”, and which facts are more likely to be demoted to “noise / disguise / exceptions”? This changes the weight structure of explanations: the same facts can be read into mutually conflicting conclusions under different lenses.  

It must be emphasized: a Cognitive Lens is not a “higher-order theory”, nor a value tribunal over reality. It describes only the **entry structure** before disputes enter three-axis positioning. It matters because it systematically changes issue salience and attention weights, and shifts argument paths—often producing a misalignment where “both sides talk about rights/justice” yet are not discussing the same level at all.

#### 2.2 Its relationship to the three axes and to Overlay Variables

- **Not an ontological axis**: a Cognitive Lens does not provide a new dimension orthogonal to X/Y/Z. It does not participate in coordinate positioning; it affects “how positioning is entered”.  
- **Not an Overlay Variable**: Overlay Variables explain “why the same core positioning, under different historical contexts, is pulled and takes on different forms”; a Cognitive Lens explains “how people organize reality into disputable objects and causality”. They can stack, but the mechanisms differ.  
- **Its relationship to ideologies**: ideologies are the objects positioned on the three axes; a Cognitive Lens is more like a portable argumentative entry, which can be absorbed by different ideologies as default grammar for narrative and mobilization, and can also coexist with other lenses within the same ideology.  

#### 2.3 Common cognitive lenses and their structural consequences

The list below is provided only as ideal types. It does not claim exhaustiveness. Each lens can appear with different intensity across contexts, and can mix with others. The analytic task is to identify which lens is dominant in a given dispute, and how it pushes discussion toward different directions on the three axes.

#### 2.4 Oppressor–Oppressed Lens

- **Problem definition**: is conflict defined first as the continued replication of structural domination (institutional arrangements, resource structures, and daily practices continuously lock in strong/weak positions)?  
- **Actors**: oppressors/oppressed; strong/weak (group position prioritized over individual behavior).  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on structural positions and institutional arrangements; the legitimacy of “correction” is more likely to tilt toward the weak; “non-intervention” is more likely to be read as default maintenance of the status quo.  
- **Evidence relevance**: emphasizes stable group-difference patterns, institutional rules, and historical accumulation; individual exceptions, short-term improvements, or “success stories” are more likely to be treated as noise/disguise/special cases.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes (directional, not definitional)**: more likely to generate legitimacy for structural correction (X toward −), to expand acceptable scope of protective intervention (Y toward −), and to stress the historicization/identity-basis/plasticity of rights (Z toward −).  

#### 2.5 Liberal Individual Lens

- **Problem definition**: is the dispute defined first as “can rules be universalized; are procedures fair; is individual liberty improperly infringed”, with a preference for repairing through universalizable rules?  
- **Actors**: individuals, contractual relations, and accountable actions (structural explanations can be admitted, but usually require clear mechanisms and strict evidence).  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on behavior, procedure, incentive mismatch, or rule-design defects; emphasizes procedural neutrality, symmetric rights, and individual responsibility; stays wary of “allocating legitimacy by group position”.  
- **Evidence relevance**: prefers verifiable and falsifiable fact chains and mechanism explanations; for grand structural narratives, it often demands testable intermediate causal channels and measurable indicators—otherwise treating them as over-inference.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes**: more likely to treat rights as prior boundaries or strong constraints (Z toward +), and to limit expansion of public coercion (Y toward +); on the economic axis, it allows greater internal diversity (it may emphasize market order, or emphasize anti-monopoly and fair opportunity).  

#### 2.6 Sovereignty–Security Lens

- **Problem definition**: is conflict defined first as a security dilemma, friend–enemy identification, and maintenance of community boundaries (survival and order prioritized)?  
- **Actors**: the state/community as high-weight actors; external threat and internal order as key variables.  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on external antagonism, vulnerability exposure, and “loss-of-control risk”; emphasizes survival, security, and boundary control; more tolerant of “risk prevention” and “emergency governance”.  
- **Evidence relevance**: emphasizes risk assessment, event chains, and worst-case reasoning; under high-threat narratives, openly verifiable information may yield to secrecy, prevention, and uncertainty-management logic.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes**: more likely to expand coercion boundaries or normalize emergency powers (Y toward −); direction on X/Z is not fixed, but their weight ordering is strongly reshuffled (e.g., economic and rights disputes are subordinated under security framing).  

#### 2.7 Conspiracy–Manipulation Lens

- **Problem definition**: are complex social outcomes defined first as manipulation and collusion by a small set of hidden actors, compressing multi-factor phenomena into a single “manipulation explanation”?  
- **Actors**: backstage blocs, “deep state”, financial oligarchs, etc. as high-agency actors; causality is compressed into a single “manipulation chain”.  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on the intentions and conspiracies of a few actors; governance failure is more likely to be attributed to “being manipulated / being sold out”; the corresponding imagination of action tends toward “exposure—purge—take back control”.  
- **Evidence relevance**: lowers trust in institutional procedures and public evidence, treating counterevidence as part of the cover-up; more receptive to “symptom evidence” and pattern association, creating a self-sealing evidentiary threshold.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes**: often distorts three-axis positioning by changing the evidentiary structure and attribution logic first; in political expression, it often couples with de-personalized blame and structural symbolization (turning complex structural problems into a few symbolic targets), increasing the risk that blame slides from testable, concrete agents to abstract symbols or substitute scapegoats.  

#### 2.8 People–Elite / Populist Lens

- **Problem definition**: is conflict defined first as representational imbalance and perceived betrayal—“the people vs elites/establishment”?  
- **Actors**: “the people” as a homogenized actor; elites as an interest community; institutional intermediaries (parties, parliament, bureaucracy, judiciary, professional bodies, etc.) are given negative weight.  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on “elite self-interest”, “institutional capture”, and “monopolized discourse”; legitimacy emphasizes direct authorization, perceptible fairness, and anti-establishment posture.  
- **Evidence relevance**: emphasizes lived experience, symbolic events, and “common-sense narratives”; more likely to distrust expert data, complex models, and procedural explanations, or treat them as whitewashing.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes**: not fixed in direction on X/Y/Z, but systematically changes the premise of “who is qualified to define the public interest”, and reshapes alliance structure and agenda salience; therefore it can couple with many three-axis combinations and should not be simply classified as “Left” or “Right”.  

#### 2.9 Weakness-as-Legitimacy Lens

- **Problem definition**: is the dispute defined first as “the weak side suffers injustice/harm”, setting the priority goal as correction and protection?  
- **Actors**: the weak/victims and the strong/perpetrators (or potential perpetrators) as the default actor frame; individual differences are more likely to be folded into group positions.  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: attribution is more likely to point to the strong side’s behavior, institutional rules, or structural conditions; legitimacy emphasizes protection and compensation, and tends to read “neutrality / non-intervention” as default continuation of existing injustice.  
- **Evidence relevance**: emphasizes the weak side’s lived experience and harm visibility; for procedural refutations or statistical counterexamples, it is more likely to require that they first explain “why they failed to capture hidden harm/power asymmetry”.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes (directional, not definitional)**: more likely to expand acceptable scope of protective intervention (Y toward −) and to strengthen arguments that use Institutional Rights as correction tools (Z toward −); on the economic axis it often couples with legitimacy for redistribution, but not necessarily in a fixed way.  

#### 2.10 Clash-of-Civilizations Lens

- **Problem definition**: is conflict defined first as value conflict and boundary friction between different civilizational/cultural systems, rather than as concrete policy and institutional failure?  
- **Actors**: civilizational communities as high-weight actors; states, religious traditions, and historical memories are treated as surface expressions of civilizational belonging.  
- **Attribution and legitimation (causal target)**: causes are placed more on irreconcilable values, historical resentment, and collisions of identity boundaries; legitimacy emphasizes cultural defense, boundary maintenance, and continuity of tradition.  
- **Evidence relevance**: emphasizes symbolic conflicts, cultural taboos, and continuity of historical narratives; lowers the weight of institutional-technical explanations and economic-interest explanations.  
- **Typical pulls on the three axes**: more likely to push disputes toward the Rights Ontology Axis (Z) (whether rights-holders are universal) and the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) (boundary and expansion of governance tools); direction on X is not fixed, but is often subordinated under “civilizational survival and security”.  

Minimal scenario: when a public controversy is interpreted as “cultural value conflict”, the focus shifts from concrete policy design to “who we are, where the boundary is, and whose rights apply to whom”.

#### 2.11 Operational guidance: how to use the “Cognitive Lens” in analysis

To avoid mistaking “entry disputes” for “axis disputes”, later chapters default to the following order:

1) identify the dominant Cognitive Lens: how it defines the problem, sets the actors, assigns attribution, and filters evidence;  
2) locate the structural disagreement on X/Y/Z: are they disputing order, boundary, or ontology;  
3) finally use Overlay Variables to explain why this combination is mobilized, institutionalized, and labeled in this particular context.
