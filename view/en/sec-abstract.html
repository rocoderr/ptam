## Abstract

This paper proposes the Political Triple-Axis Model to address the long-standing confusion, overlap, and misclassification surrounding “Left” and “Right” in contemporary political discourse. Across countries, issues, and historical contexts, the same labels often point to different—and sometimes contradictory—positions. A single linear spectrum, Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Models, or loosely stacked “multi-dimensional scales” struggle to explain this complexity. They also fail to distinguish which differences stem from fundamental ontological disagreements and which are strategic, historical, or situational overlays. In contrast, this model decomposes political positions into three independent and orthogonal ontological axes:

1. Economic Order Axis
2. Liberty Boundary Axis
3. Rights Ontology Axis

The model is not an empirically expandable scale. It selects three core ontological axes that are irreducible to each other and symmetric in abstraction level. These three axes answer three foundational questions: how resources are organized and allocated; where coercive power ends (that is, how the boundary of liberty is drawn); and whether rights are understood as prior to institutions.

The Rights Ontology Axis is a distinctive feature and one of the model’s key innovations. It makes the ontological assumptions behind rights claims explicit and, through a reproducible decision procedure, seeks to clarify many disputes that are difficult to interpret using only the economic axis or the liberty axis.

On top of the three ontological axes, this paper introduces the Institutional Stability Domain (ISD): the intersection of the low-risk intervals on each main axis. ISD is used to describe which institutional combinations are more likely to remain workable, correctable, and sustainable over time, and to explain political crises and institutional disorder as trajectories that deviate away from that domain.

Beyond the three ontological axes, the model introduces Overlay Variables to describe non-ontological factors such as nationalism, globalization, religious traditions, identity politics, technological conditions, elite–mass structures, and war and security. These factors do not constitute additional main axes of left–right differentiation, but they can strongly shape how the three axes are expressed and combined in real politics, and can exert situational pulls on positioning along non-core axes.

The model’s value lies in its explanatory power. Many political ideas and movements that appear contradictory, hybrid, or hard to classify within conventional left–right frameworks become clearer and more stable once decomposed across the three axes. A political position can point in different directions across different axes; this is not a logical inconsistency, but a natural result of the multi-dimensional structure of political disagreement.

The Political Triple-Axis Model is an explanatory model/framework rather than a normative theory. It does not make value judgments or rank political positions. Instead, it aims to provide a clearer, comparable, and reusable analytical language for understanding the genuine sources of ideological difference, the tensions within them, and the ways those differences intersect and misalign across societies and historical periods.
