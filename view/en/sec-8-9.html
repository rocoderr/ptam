### 9. A Real Conflict Under Multiple Overlay Variables: the Israel–Palestine Conflict

“The Israel–Palestine conflict / Israel issue” often shows a typical “left–right misalignment” across the world: the same stance—“support Israel” or “support Palestine”—can correspond to very different three-axis structures in different countries and camps. The key is not that the position is “naturally too complex”. It is that the object of discussion is frequently swapped within dialogue, so one moral language is used to cover problems at different levels.

#### 9.1 First decompose into three objects: identity—state-building—conflict governance

- **Object 1: Jews as a people (ethnic/religious group)**  
  This is the identity–rights level: discrimination, historical memory, and how Identity Rights are protected; the core entry is Z.  
- **Object 2: Israel as a sovereign nation-state**  
  This is the state–war level: border governance, counterterrorism, war, and constraints on emergency power; the core entry is Y.  
- **Object 3: Antisemitism as an explanation-and-mobilization template**  
  This is the narrative–blame level: whether blame becomes de-individualized and whether conspiratorial explanation appears; the core entry is Z plus the overlay layer (see the previous section).

Once these three objects are mixed, a common misreading appears: reading “opposition to some policies” as “denying the state’s existence”, or sliding “denying the state’s existence” into “denying Jews”. The first step of three-axis analysis is always to fix the object.

#### 9.2 Decompose “who do you support” into four comparable questions (each maps to a different axis)

In real talk, “who I support” often bundles multiple questions into one answer. To make cross-country camp comparison testable, it can be decomposed into four more specific questions:

- **Question A (Z + Membership-Based Rights): national self-determination and membership**  
  How are Jewish national self-determination and Palestinian national self-determination understood? Where is the boundary between Membership-Based Rights and universal individual rights?  
- **Question B (Y): war, occupation, and coercion boundaries**  
  To what extent can “self-defense / counterterrorism / border governance” expand coercion boundaries? How are procedural constraints kept effective?  
- **Question C (Z): rights-holders and responsibility units**  
  Are rights and responsibilities assigned to individuals, or to groups/states? When does de-individualized blame appear?  
- **Question D (overlay layer): internationalism, religion, and geopolitics**  
  Is the conflict embedded into an “international order / human rights” narrative, or into a “sovereignty / civilizational boundary” narrative? How do Religion / Secularization and geopolitical positioning shape expression?

These questions explain a common phenomenon: many quarrels are not “conflicting answers”, but different parties answering different questions.
