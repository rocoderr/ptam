### 3. Legitimacy Narratives for Political Mobilization: Populism, Elitism, and Meritocracy

#### 3.1 People–elite mobilization structure: why Populism is treated first as an Overlay Variable

**(1) Positioning in this framework**  
Populism describes how a legitimacy narrative organizes conflict, rather than providing stable coordinates on the three axes. Its core grammar narrates politics as “the people” vs “the elite”, and claims legitimacy mainly from “the unified will of the people”. So it functions more like a mobilization structure or a legitimacy “entry point”, not a fixed stance on the Economic Order Axis (X), Liberty Boundary Axis (Y), or Rights Ontology Axis (Z).

**(2) Why Populism is not “Left / Right”**  
Populism answers “how to fight”, not “what is being fought over”. The three axes ask three institutional questions: how economic order is arranged (X), how coercion boundaries are drawn (Y), and how rights are understood at root (Z). Populism asks a different kind of question: where legitimacy is narratively sourced, who the conflict is organized between, and which mediating institutions are treated as “captured” or “untrustworthy”. Therefore, political practices called “populism” can land in very different places on X/Y/Z. Projecting populism directly onto “Left” or “Right” usually mistakes mobilization slogans for institutional consequences.

**(3) A strict rule: whenever “populist / anti-elite” appears, ask for its institutional landing**  
The word “populism” cannot function as a three-axis conclusion. At most it is an “entry-point description”. A real classification must return to concrete claims: what taxes, what regulation, what welfare, what immigration system, what emergency powers, what speech boundaries, what rights boundaries. Otherwise the same label will cover conflicting three-axis combinations.

#### 3.2 Decomposing Populism back into the three axes: three common “payloads” (and their left–right directions)

Populism seems “everywhere” in real politics not because it is a unified “-ism”, but because it is a highly general-purpose assembly interface. It packages diverse issues into a story of “the people are betrayed / manipulated”, and demands “taking back control”. Only by decomposing it back into X/Y/Z can we see what it is actually pushing.

##### (1) X (Economic Order Axis): Populism can move left or right—key is “opposed to whose economic dominance”

**A. Anti-finance / anti-oligarchy redistributive populism (X-leaning left; toward X−)**  
When “the elite” is defined mainly as financial capital, multinational capital, monopolies, and captured regulators, and the program includes higher taxes, stronger antitrust, welfare expansion, industrial policy, or redistribution mechanisms, the economic order usually drifts toward stronger public allocation—leftward on X (toward X−). The core is not “anti-expert” emotion. It is an institutional claim that market competition has been structurally distorted and public power must rebuild distribution and competition order.

**B. Anti-tax / anti-regulation small-government populism (X-leaning right; toward X+)**  
When “the elite” is defined mainly as bureaucracy, regulators, taxation machinery, and the establishment that “takes your income”, and the program is tax cuts, deregulation, welfare cuts, or smaller government spending, the economic order usually drifts toward stronger market allocation—rightward on X (toward X+). Here “the people” are framed as taxpayers and small business owners, while “the elite” are framed as rent-seeking institutional gatekeepers.

##### (2) Y (Liberty Boundary Axis): Populism can become “strongman centralization” or “anti-establishment limits on government”

**A. “Strongman—centralization—direct authorization” populism (Y-leaning left; toward Y−)**  
When populism narrates “the people’s will” as systematically blocked by institutional intermediaries (parliament, courts, media, bureaucracy), and then argues for weakening checks, expanding executive discretion, and using emergency powers or exception mechanisms to rapidly “deliver the people’s will”, coercive tool acceptability rises. Y tightens leftward (toward Y−). The key is not the word “people”, but hostility toward procedures and checks, which lowers caution toward coercion expansion.

**B. “Anti-establishment—limit power—anti-capture” populism (Y-leaning right; toward Y+)**  
When populism defines “the elite” as a state apparatus captured by interest groups, and therefore argues to limit regulatory power, intelligence/police power, shrink administrative scope, strengthen local autonomy, or strengthen procedural constraints on government, it can move toward less coercion and more refusable constraints—rightward on Y (toward Y+). The institutional goal is not “a stronger state”, but “a weaker state”. The target is not procedure as such, but coercion expansion under monopolized and captured procedures.

##### (3) Z (Rights Ontology Axis): when “the unified will of the people” is treated as the highest source, Z tensions are amplified

**A. A tendency toward “majority will can rewrite boundaries” (Z-leaning left; toward Z−)**  
When populism elevates “the unified will of the people” into the highest legitimacy and implies (explicitly or implicitly) that some rights boundaries can be rewritten for “the people’s interest / national revival / social purification”, rights slide from “pre-political constraints” toward “politically reshaped by goals”. Z drifts leftward (toward Z−). Rights stop being the boundary of the majority and become the tool of the majority.

**B. A tendency toward “rights are a boundary even the majority cannot cross” (Z-leaning right; toward Z+)**  
Conversely, if populism says “return power to the people” while still insisting that majority will cannot negate minorities’ basic rights and that judicial boundaries and due process cannot be pierced by “the general will”, it can remain on the right side of Z (Z+). The key is whether it accepts that “the people” must also be constrained by rights boundaries. When “the unified will of the people” is treated as the highest source, whether rights can bind the majority becomes a core fault line—amplifying the tension between Z+ and Z−.

#### 3.3 Populism as a Cognitive Lens: how it systematically distorts three-axis classification (People–Elite / Populist Lens)

One extra layer is needed. Populism is not only an “issue packager”. It often changes the structure of evidence and responsibility attribution. In the Cognitive Lens chapter, this is summarized as the People–Elite / Populist Lens.

Under this lens, debate tends to turn first into “who is qualified to define the public interest”, then “are the mediating institutions captured”, and only then into specific policy content. As a result, even when a policy bundle could be positioned clearly on X/Y/Z, three recurring deviations appear:

**(1) Homogenizing subjects: “the people” as a homogeneous agent; “the elite” as an interest community**  
Once subjects are homogenized, discussion naturally shifts toward moralized blame rather than institutional tradeoffs. X (allocation mechanisms) and Y (coercion boundaries) are pushed behind a narrative goal of “purging who” or “taking back control”, producing a common sequencing of “mobilization first, institutions later”.

**(2) Negative-weighting intermediaries: parties, parliament, bureaucracy, courts, and professional bodies default to “untrustworthy”**  
When intermediaries are treated as untrustworthy by default, procedures and checks are more easily framed as obstacles. Even if a claim is not necessarily Y− in content, its implementation path becomes more tolerant of coercive tools that bypass procedure, producing a leftward drift in Y outcomes.

**(3) Switching evidence preference: privileging visible experience, symbolic events, and “common-sense narrative”, distrusting expert models and procedural explanations**  
This is not “the people are more ignorant”. It is a mobilization-driven rearrangement of evidentiary thresholds: more shareable, resonant, and blame-assignable evidence types are prioritized. Therefore, three-axis analysis must distinguish “slogan layer” from “institutional layer” more strictly, or it will misread narrative style as institutional stance.

#### 3.4 The interface between Populism and the Antisemitism template: the risk is not “anti-elite”, but “conspiratorialization and de-individualized blame”

Populist narratives have a structural risk: when they compress complex structures into a story of “being controlled by a small minority”, they create an interface for imagining “a backstage manipulator”. The danger of Antisemitism is not “anti-elite” as such. It is whether the narrative shifts into de-individualized blame and conspiratorial explanation. This can be stated as identifiable criteria:

**(1) Sliding from falsifiable policy critique to an “omnipotent explanation term”**  
When discussion slides from “a policy / an interest group” to “an everywhere-behind-the-scenes group”, and counter-evidence is reinterpreted as part of the conspiracy, the dispute is no longer a three-axis argument. It becomes “template capture”. Any X/Y/Z positioning will be distorted because the object of dispute has shifted from institutional consequences to symbolic blame.

**(2) Sliding from individual/organizational responsibility to essentialized group responsibility (a typical trigger for Z drifting left)**  
Once “the elite” is replaced by an identity group as a total responsibility-bearer, rights-holders are rewritten in an all-at-once manner. Z drifts toward Z− and often couples with higher tolerance for coercion (Y−). Put differently: the antisemitic template is not “exclusive to the Right”. More stably, it corresponds to the Z− structural risk of de-individualized blame, not to a fixed Left/Right label.

#### 3.5 Elitism and Meritocracy: separating legitimacy source from selection rules (Overlay Variables, but must return to axis landings)

Symmetric to how nationalism answers “who we are”, elitism and meritocracy answer “who should govern, and by what right”. In this framework they are also treated first as Overlay Variables: they strongly shape how three-axis positions are expressed, but they do not directly constitute the three ontological axes.

##### (1) Elitism and meritocracy: related but not identical

- Elitism emphasizes that governing legitimacy comes from a minority’s ability, expertise, or order-maintenance function; political organization tends to be represented, guided, or dominated by elites.
- Meritocracy emphasizes that positions, resources, and status should be allocated and selected mainly by some “ability / achievement / merit” standard. It can be used to justify elite structures, but it can also be framed as a demand for opportunity structure and procedural fairness.

So meritocracy can serve as a legitimacy argument for elitism, but they are not synonyms: the former is a “rule”, the latter is a “governing structure and legitimacy narrative”.

##### (2) Returning disputes to institutional questions: how they pull the three axes (with left–right directions)

**A. Effects on X: correcting opportunity structure vs reinforcing competitive returns**  
When merit narratives enter education, employment, and distribution, dispute shifts to whether opportunity structure needs institutional correction. If one argues for public investment, quotas, redistribution, or systemic compensation to “fix the starting line”, it is closer to the left side of X (toward X−). If one argues to shrink correction and reinforce competition and return rules, it is closer to the right side of X (toward X+). The key is not whether one praises hard work, but whether one chooses “market competition” or “public allocation” to realize the preferred sense of fairness.

**B. Effects on Y: authorization boundaries in technocratic governance and emergency management**  
Elitism more easily couples with technocratic governance, professional administration, and emergency management, pushing “authorization scope and procedural constraints” to the foreground. If one argues that crisis governance requires larger executive discretion, faster decisions, and fewer procedural frictions, Y tends to drift leftward (toward Y−). If one insists authorization must be strictly procedurally constrained, transparent, reviewable, and correctable, Y is closer to the right (toward Y+). This amplifies Y divergence from the midpoint to both sides.

**C. Effects on Z: ability/contribution as a condition for rights and access to resources**  
When “ability/contribution” is used as a condition for rights or access to public resources (e.g., excluding some groups from certain rights or public resources due to “insufficient ability / insufficient contribution”), the universality boundary of rights comes into tension with stratification logic. The more rights are treated as a universal floor, the more Z is on the right (Z+). The more rights are treated as stratifiable and rewritable for institutional goals, the more Z drifts leftward (Z−). This raises the tension between Z+ and Z−.

##### (3) The symmetric relation with Populism: not mutually exclusive positions, but competing legitimacy narratives

Populism uses “the will of the people” as a legitimacy entry point, while elitism/meritocracy uses “ability—order—procedure”. Both can ally with different X/Y/Z combinations, and within the same country they can alternate dominance depending on crisis conditions and media structure. Projecting “anti-elite / pro-elite” directly onto Left/Right hides the real three-axis disagreements.

#### 3.6 Europe’s “Right-wing rise”: why it is often misread as an overall rightward shift, and a more reliable three-axis decomposition

Media and public talk often equate “national populism / anti-establishment” with “the entire Right shifting rightward”. Under the three-axis framework, a more accurate method is to separate “mobilization entry point (populism)” from “issue bundle (actual X/Y/Z landing)”.

##### (1) Why it is labeled “the Right”: narrative objects and identity boundaries are more salient

In many European countries, forces called a “right-wing rise” often foreground immigration, public order, borders, and cultural identity. These issues easily activate political-community boundary and membership discussion, making “strong boundaries” more visible on Z (who counts as a rights-holder; whether rights are stratified by membership) and on Y (border control, policing, exception powers). This is a rightward tilt in agenda salience, not necessarily an X-axis rightward shift.

##### (2) Two common branches on X: the economy is not always “more market”

- Some “national populisms” argue for welfare prioritized for domestic members, industrial protection, anti-globalized supply chains, and even stronger state intervention. This can be left-leaning on X (X− or the left side of X0) while being more rightward/strong-boundary on Z/Y.
- Others define “the elite” as the tax-and-regulation machine and argue for tax cuts, deregulation, smaller welfare, and smaller state spending. This branch is more typically rightward on X (toward X+).

So “Europe’s right-wing rise” often looks cross-axis mixed rather than a neat “all-axes right shift”. This is exactly why populism must be treated as an Overlay Variable: it can load mutually contradictory economic claims into the same “people vs elite” narrative.

##### (3) Y and Z are easiest to push into high-risk zones: key is whether it moves toward “strongman—exceptionalization”

When “taking back control” is interpreted as hostility to procedural checks, systematic denial of courts and media, and the legitimization of emergency-power expansion via “popular authorization”, Y often drifts toward Y−. When “the people’s will” is used to rewrite rights boundaries and treat minority rights as sacrificeable for “community security / purity / efficiency”, Z also drifts toward Z−. By contrast, if the main direction is “anti-capture institutional reform” emphasizing transparency and procedural accountability, Y can drift toward Y+, and whether Z stays on the right (Z+) depends on whether it recognizes a rights floor that “even the majority cannot cross”.

#### 3.7 Section summary

- (1) Populism is not a three-axis coordinate. It is a legitimacy entry point that organizes conflict as “the people vs the elite”. It answers “how to fight”, not “what is being fought over”.
- (2) Populism can move left or right on X/Y/Z. It must be decomposed back into institutional consequences: on X it can load anti-capital redistribution (toward X−) or anti-tax/anti-regulation (toward X+); on Y it can load strongman centralization (toward Y−) or anti-establishment limits on power (toward Y+); on Z it depends on whether it accepts rights as a pre-political boundary binding majority will (Z+ vs Z−).
- (3) Elitism and meritocracy are also Overlay Variables: the former is a governing structure and legitimacy narrative; the latter is a selection/allocation rule. Through opportunity structure, authorization boundaries, and rights universality, they pull how X/Y/Z are expressed and where they land.
- (4) The high-risk interface of populist narratives is compressing complex structures into a conspiratorial story of “being controlled by a small minority”, inducing de-individualized blame and scapegoating mechanisms. The danger is not “anti-elite”, but “conspiratorialization + group essentialization”.
