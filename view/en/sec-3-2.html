### 2. Liberty Boundary Axis: Why the Economic Order Axis Is Not Enough

Using only the Economic Order Axis produces systematic distortion in two kinds of scenarios.

The first scenario is common: two people can be very close on economic questions, yet hold stable opposition on speech control, media control, judicial independence, privacy and surveillance, and emergency powers. The disagreement is not “a bit more or less tax”, but “who has the right to coerce you, and how far coercion can reach”.

The second scenario is especially contemporary: for many hot issues, their political salience does not come first from resource distribution, but from the coercion boundary itself. Public health and coercive measures, counter-terrorism and surveillance, platform content governance, policing boundaries, and the normalization of states of emergency can all reshape camps without changing the property-rights structure.

Historically, academia and public discourse did try “adding a second line”. Two-dimensional frameworks such as the Nolan Chart and the Political Compass draw “economic liberty” and “personal liberty” as two axes to explain combinations such as “economically left but personally right”. Yet these framings often treat liberty as a value label, or conflate “economic liberty” with the Economic Order Axis, which makes the axis object unclear and the abstraction level inconsistent.

The Political Triple-Axis Model takes a more constrained step here: it defines the second axis strictly as an axis about the structure of coercion, not an axis about a virtue.

#### 2.1 Main-axis definition: what question does it answer?

The Liberty Boundary Axis studies the boundary and attribution of coercive power, and thereby describes the institutional boundary of liberty. Here “liberty” is defined in a very specific way: liberty is the actionable space beyond the reach of coercion. This definition carries no value judgment about whether liberty is admirable. It is a structural concept. Therefore, drawing the boundary of liberty is, in essence, drawing the boundary of coercion.

Core questions on this axis:

- Who has the right to coerce whom?  
- Under what conditions is coercion treated as legitimate?  
- Should the coercion boundary be narrower or wider? Should procedural constraints be stronger or weaker?  

#### 2.2 Direction and midpoint: what do − and + mean?

We denote the two directions of the Liberty Boundary Axis as negative (−) and positive (+):

- **Left side of Y (Y−)**: emphasizes that the coercion boundary can expand; it expands the reachable scope of public power in the name of security, order, or risk prevention, and tolerates more normalized governance tools (a “control/security-first” position).  
- **Right side of Y (Y+)**: emphasizes that the coercion boundary should contract; procedural constraints should be stronger; emergency powers should be more limited; privacy and expressive space should be larger (a “liberty-first” position).  
- **Midpoint of Y (Y0)**: often appears as “limited coercion + strong constraints”: it accepts that some public risks require coercive intervention, but insists that procedures and boundaries must be institutionally constrained.

#### 2.3 Sub-axes: how coercion boundaries become visible across domains

The Liberty Boundary Axis is commonly operationalized through the following Sub-axes:

| Category | Variables (Left − vs Right +) |
| :------: | :---------------------------- |
| Overall | security/control first vs liberty first |
| Information and public expression sub-axis | speech control vs freedom of speech<br>media control vs press freedom |
| Platform governance sub-axis | strong platform content governance vs weak platform content governance |
| Rule of law and procedures sub-axis | judiciary subordinated to politics vs judicial independence<br>substantive results first vs procedural justice first |
| Policing and punishment sub-axis | strong policing/heavy penalties/expanded enforcement power vs weak policing/lighter penalties/strong procedural constraints<br>retain the death penalty vs abolish the death penalty |
| Security and surveillance sub-axis | surveillance and public security first vs privacy rights first<br>gun control vs gun rights first |
| Emergency governance sub-axis | normalized emergency governance vs limited emergency powers |
| Risk governance sub-axis | state risk prevention vs risk self-responsibility<br>public health mandates vs bodily autonomy<br>(e.g., vaccine mandates/passes/employment conditions) |
| Environmental and climate-risk governance sub-axis | precautionary principle and strong regulation vs minimal intervention and risk self-responsibility<br>(e.g., caps/bans/mandatory standards vs voluntary cuts/market adjustment) |
| Government size and responsibility sub-axis | big government vs small government<br>state protection first vs personal responsibility first |
| Norms and intervention sub-axis (coercion boundary only) | norm-enforced social order vs tolerant free order<br>morality-active intervention vs moral neutrality<br>drug criminalization vs decriminalization/public-health approach<br>sex work criminalization vs legalization/decriminalization |

These Sub-axes may look dispersed, but they rotate around one thing: how far coercion can reach, by whom, and through what procedures.

#### 2.4 Sources of coercion: typically state coercion, but analysis should not be locked to the state

In everyday language, the most typical form of coercive power is of course state/government coercion: law, regulation, enforcement, judicial rulings, and punitive capacity. In modern politics, such coercion is the most visible and decisive, so the Liberty Boundary Axis typically takes it as the default reference.

But structurally, the Liberty Boundary Axis does not restrict “coercion” to “state violence”. It concerns a more general relation: when some force can turn “refusal” into a practically unbearable option (or makes refusal require a prohibitively high price), then even if its nominal source is not the state, it functionally participates in drawing the boundary of liberty. In other words, this axis measures not “where coercion comes from”, but “how coercion is realized; whether it can be refused; what refusal costs; and whether feasible exit paths exist”.

To avoid treating different sources of constraint as the same kind of “pressure”, this paper distinguishes three structural types (they can stack, and transitions can occur):

- **State Coercion**: carried by law, administrative orders, enforcement, and judicial institutions. Refusal triggers enforceable legal consequences (fines, criminal liability, license/permit risks, etc.), with concentrated execution power in the state or quasi-state agencies. Typical features: non-refusable, power-asymmetric, and extremely high exit costs.  
- **Institutional Pressure**: carried by organizational rules and access systems (platform rules, employment relations, professional associations and review systems, funding and distribution channels, etc.). It may be “optional” in form, but non-compliance significantly affects viability and feasible paths (termination, takedown/bans, algorithmic downranking, professional-network exclusion). Typical features: nominally refusable but high exit costs, with consequences concentrated and realized through a few key nodes.  
- **Discursive Pressure**: carried by public opinion, academic criticism, and public discussion. There is no unified enforcer and no direct institutionalized consequence; the main effects are reputational evaluation and discursive competition. Typical features: in principle ignorable, rebuttable, and exitable; coerciveness is weak or close to neutral.

**How non-state coercion “expands” into quasi-state coercion**

The Liberty Boundary Axis must attend to non-state forms because modern societies have a common structural pathway: discursive pressure is not coercion by itself, but it can bind with institutional pressure and thereby “cash out” reputational costs into real punishment, approaching state coercion in effect. The key is not whether motives are benevolent, but whether three structural conditions are jointly satisfied:

- **Dependence intensifies**: individuals become highly dependent on platforms, employers, professional networks, or funding channels, with scarce substitutes, making “exit” practically infeasible.  
- **Enforcement nodes concentrate**: a small number of organizational nodes can realize consequences in a concentrated way (deplatforming, termination, delisting, cutting payment/advertising systems, removing distribution channels), allowing pressure to become rapidly convertible into predictable punishment.  
- **Reputation is capitalized**: in some professions and industries, reputation itself is tradable capital for employment and financing. When reputational loss is stably converted into loss of jobs and resource opportunities, discursive pressure more easily acquires “quasi-coercive” effects.

When these conditions stack, the coercion boundary can “shrink in practice” even if legal texts do not change: people stop certain expression or action not because “the state forbids it”, but because the cost of refusal becomes unbearable within platform–organization–market structures. In such cases, positioning on the Liberty Boundary Axis should incorporate these non-state coercive effects into the same structural map, rather than using “did the state act” as the only threshold.
