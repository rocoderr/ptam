### 8. Expanding gun control to strengthen the state monopoly of violence

#### 8.1 Initial Position: institutional recognition of private gun rights

In some countries’ traditions, private gun ownership and use is treated as a right recognized by law, sometimes by constitution:

- **Z:** gun rights are treated as close to pre-political individual rights tied to self-defense, liberty, or civic identity (Z+ or Z0).  
- **Y:** state intervention in private weapons is relatively limited; regulation focuses more on ex post enforcement than systematic restriction on possession itself.  
- **X:** production, sale, and circulation are mainly market-driven; regulation focuses on licensing and registration.

Private gun ownership is treated as institutionally tolerable, not a risk source to be persistently compressed.

#### 8.2 Contextual Scenario: security anxiety after public violence events

This motion is proposed when:

- high-impact gun violence causes mass casualties;  
- private guns are treated as persistent, unpredictable public-safety risk;  
- existing regulation is criticized as ineffective for preventing recurrence.

The focus shifts from “who should own guns” to whether private-weapon space should be systematically compressed to reduce overall violence risk.

#### 8.3 Motion Statement

**To reduce social violence risk, the state should, through stricter licensing, possession limits, and buy-back/recovery schemes, restrict private gun ownership and use, strengthening the state’s monopoly on legitimate violence.**

The core is the institutional attribution of violence resources, moving more violence capacity back under state control.

#### 8.4 Structural Consequences: private violence space shrinks; state coercion moves forward

- **Z:** gun rights shift from near pre-political individual rights into conditional, revocable institutional permission (Z→−).  
- **Y:** state intervention into private violence moves forward, covering possession and prevention stages rather than only ex post illegality (Y→−).  
- **X:** the arms industry shrinks and is more strictly controlled by the state over production, circulation, and sales.

The core consequence is redefining the institutional boundary of legitimate violence and reducing private violence space via persistent control.
