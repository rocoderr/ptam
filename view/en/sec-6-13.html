### 13. Conservatism: Treating It as a Cross-Axis Label

Within the classical ideology spectrum, Conservatism is a relatively stable ideological form in contemporary politics. It forms a consistent, repeatable combination around economic order, coercion boundaries, and rights ontology, so it can be positioned stably in the Political Triple-Axis Model.

**Economic Order Axis (X)**

**Position: X = +2 (Right)**

- Its basic stance is to treat market mechanisms and private decision-making as the primary means of resource allocation.  
- It tends to see price signals, property arrangements, and decentralized decisions as more reliable coordination bases, and rejects the state as the main allocator.  

More specifically:

- It supports institutional confirmation of private property and treats it as a precondition for stable economic order and individual autonomy.  
- It resists sustained substitution of market mechanisms with political objectives, especially plan-based or goal-driven allocation.  
- It does not deny public economic arrangements entirely, but confines them to complementary and exceptional roles.  

Therefore, Conservatism’s position on the X axis is best placed at **+2**: it clearly leans toward market-led order while still recognizing the ontological legitimacy of public economic roles.

**Liberty Boundary Axis (Y)**

**Position: Y = +2 (Right)**

- Its core concern is limiting the expansion of coercion boundaries, especially the front-loading and normalization of state coercion.  
- It emphasizes that liberty does not come from coercive redistribution, but from institutional constraints on coercive power.  

More specifically:

- It typically favors limited government, small government, and separation of powers, treating coercion as ex post and exceptional, under strict procedural limits.  
- It values constitutional structure, judicial independence, and due process as key institutional checks on runaway coercion.  
- Unlike positions that deny order and rules, it insists that order should not depend on ever-expanding intervention and control.  

Therefore, Conservatism’s position on the Y axis is also **+2**: it clearly opposes expansion of coercion while not denying the conditional legitimacy of state coercion.

**Rights Ontology Axis (Z)**

**Position: Z = +2 (Right)**

On rights ontology, Conservatism leans toward a pre-political understanding of rights. It holds that some core rights exist prior to institutions and must be acknowledged and protected.

More specifically:

In property rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and due process, Conservatism treats these rights as upper boundaries that institutions must recognize and safeguard.  
It stresses that institutions are responsible for stabilizing these rights, not repeatedly redefining them through legislation or policy.  
At the same time, it is highly cautious about elevating new social claims into “basic rights/human rights”, especially in identity rights, group rights, and outcome-oriented rights.  
In this sense, it explicitly resists upgrading negotiable institutional arrangements into non-vetoable rights boundaries.  

Therefore, Conservatism’s position on the Z axis can be stably placed at **+2**: it affirms the pre-political status of rights while not moving to the extreme of denying any institutional carriers or any conditionality of rights.

**Three-axis positioning summary**

In the Political Triple-Axis Model, Conservatism can be summarized as:

Economic Order Axis: X = +2  
Liberty Boundary Axis: Y = +2  
Rights Ontology Axis: Z = +2  

This positioning indicates a consistent rightward orientation on all three ontological axes without reaching ontological extremes on any axis. That stable combination is what gives Conservatism its institutional continuity and enduring influence in real-world politics.
