### 13. Conservatism: Treating It as a Cross-Axis Label

Conservatism is more like a cross-axis label: it usually expresses a tendency to “maintain existing order and tradition”, rather than an ideology with a single fixed coordinate on the three ontological axes. Therefore, the key is to first detach it from the illusion of “it looks like an axis”, and then decompose it into comparable X/Y/Z combinations.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type: common constitutional-conservative combination)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: commonly midpoint-to-right (X0/X+) (leans market and private property, but can accommodate protective arrangements for intermediary structures such as traditional industries and family structures)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: commonly midpoint-to-left (Y0/Y−) (more tolerant of public coercion tools in public order, moral order, immigration, and border governance)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: commonly on the right (Z+) (emphasizes natural order and prior boundaries; more wary of radical rewriting of rights-holders and category boundaries)  

**Structural core**

The structural core is not an endpoint on one axis, but a preference for “order continuity and risk”: it tends to prefer small, reversible revisions within existing institutions, and stays highly cautious about radical reconstruction.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- it emphasizes Rights–Responsibilities Symmetry; rights boundaries are often bundled with responsibilities, membership, and maintenance of order.  
- it is more cautious about expansion of Identity Rights, tending to discuss them under an Institutional Rights framework.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Change / Stability  
- Secular / Religious  
- Rationalism / Bounded Rationality  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- historical memory and trauma: stronger historical ruptures more readily strengthen preference for order continuity and institutional stability.  
- social-structural segmentation and value conflict: rising conflict can push Y leftward in the name of maintaining order.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Conservatism is often simply equated with “the Right”, but its core is risk and time orientation, not a fixed X-axis position. Across historical contexts, it can coexist with multiple X/Y combinations.
