### 6. Mnemonics for Quick Classification

#### 6.1 Economic Order Axis (X)

What are you judging?

One-sentence mnemonic:

> Look at “who mainly allocates resources.”

Ask only one question:

- Where does the main decision authority for resource allocation come from?

Typical markers on the right:

- market prices
- private decisions
- decentralized choice
- the state only provides a floor or rules

Typical markers on the left:

- state or collective decisions
- planning, quotas, unified allocation
- outcome correction prioritized over process liberty

Common misclassification reminders:

- “Some government intervention” does not equal left.
- “Opposing big capital” does not equal left.
- The key is: who makes the final call, and who bears responsibility for distribution?

#### 6.2 Liberty Boundary Axis (Y)

What are you judging?

One-sentence mnemonic:

> Look at “whether I can legally say no.”

Ask only one question:

- Is refusal still a recognized and protected option?

Typical markers on the right:

- even if you disagree, you cannot be forced
- offense and non-endorsement are not, by themselves, punishable reasons
- coercion is legitimate only in very limited scenarios

Typical markers on the left:

- to prevent harm, the space for refusal can be compressed
- non-cooperation and non-endorsement are treated as deserving consequences
- the legitimacy of coercion keeps expanding

Key reminders:

- coercion does not come only from the state
- when refusal is “extremely costly” in practice, the liberty boundary has been substantively compressed

#### 6.3 Rights Ontology Axis (Z)

What are you judging?

One-sentence mnemonic (most important):

> Look at “whether rights are recognized by institutions, or used to override institutions.”

Ask only one question:

- Are rights prior to institutions, or redefined by politics?

Typical Z+ understanding:

- rights are treated as pre-political
- the institution’s task is to recognize, protect, and enforce
- rights boundaries are relatively stable

Typical Z− understanding:

- rights themselves can be redefined
- identity, structure, and history can directly generate rights
- rights can be used to veto institutional choices

This axis is the easiest to overlook, but the most critical.

Many contemporary conflicts look, on the surface, like disputes about:

- speech
- manners
- policy

But in structure, they are divergences along this axis.

#### 6.4 Quick Combinational Heuristics (Practical Mnemonics)

- Z axis first, Y axis enforces, X axis supplies → the most common structure of Wokeism
- Z axis unchanged; disputes stay on X and Y → usually the traditional left–right dispute
- Z axis pulled downward; Y axis tightens rapidly → a high-risk ideological zone
