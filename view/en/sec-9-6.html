### 6. Allowing euthanasia under specified conditions

#### 6.1 Initial Position: the principle of inalienability of the right to life

Under traditional criminal-law and medical-ethics frameworks, the right to life is treated as non-waivable and non-authorizable for termination:

- **Z:** the right to life is treated as absolute; it does not depend on individual will; institutions protect life rather than evaluate its value.  
- **Y:** any assistance in dying or active life termination is prohibited; medical systems aim to preserve life; coercion appears as prohibition rather than permission.  
- **X:** medical resource allocation centers on treatment, relief, and life extension; life-ending is not a legitimate institutional option.

Under this structure, even explicit extreme-case wishes to end life lack institutional effect.

#### 6.2 Contextual Scenario: autonomy claim under extreme medical conditions

This motion is proposed under scenarios such as:

- an irreversible, incurable disease with long-term severe suffering;  
- medicine can only prolong the process, not improve living condition;  
- the individual clearly and persistently expresses the wish to end life.

The focus shifts from “protect life or not” to whether institutions should recognize decision power over manner of life ending in extreme conditions.

#### 6.3 Motion Statement

**Under strict medical assessment and procedural conditions, the state should allow euthanasia for specified patients, recognizing limited autonomy over the manner of life ending in extreme conditions.**

The motion does not deny the right to life; it argues that the right to life includes limited autonomy over life-ending under specified conditions.

#### 6.4 Structural Consequences: institutional rewriting of the content of the right to life

- **Z:** the right to life shifts from absolute and inalienable to a right that can, under certain conditions, be autonomously ended by the rights-holder; its content is rewritten.  
- **Y:** the state shifts from total prohibitor to permission-and-regulation; coercion form shifts from “ban ending” to “regulate ending”.  
- **X:** health-system goal structure changes; resources must cover assessment, procedure, and end-stage; life-extension is no longer the sole institutional orientation.

The core impact is changing the institutional stance on when and how life may end.
