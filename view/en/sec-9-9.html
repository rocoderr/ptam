### 9. Shifting drug governance from criminal punishment to public-health governance

#### 9.1 Initial Position: a drug governance structure centered on criminal punishment

Under traditional drug governance, drugs are mainly treated as a criminal issue:

- **Y:** highly coercive criminal control over production, circulation, and use; enforcement is front-loaded; punishment is the main tool (Y−).  
- **Z:** users are treated as illegal subjects; their rights are weak in governance logic; focus is punishment rather than rights recognition.  
- **X:** state resources flow into enforcement/regulation/punishment systems; the market is pushed underground into opaque illegal economy.

The core goal is prohibition and deterrence rather than health improvement or social integration.

#### 9.2 Contextual Scenario: long-run limits of criminal governance

This motion is proposed when:

- long-term high-intensity enforcement fails to reduce use rates significantly;  
- underground markets breed violence, corruption, and transnational crime;  
- users cycle through prison without addiction improvement; public costs rise.

Then drugs are redescribed as a public problem centered on health, addiction, and social support rather than pure crime.

#### 9.3 Motion Statement

**The state should remove drug use and dependence from the criminal punishment system and instead govern through public health, medical intervention, and social support mechanisms.**

The key is not denying drug risk; it is changing the basic institutional classification of the drug problem.

#### 9.4 Structural Consequences: coercion retreats; rights recover; allocation is reshuffled

- **Y:** criminal coercion toward users retreats; enforcement shifts from punishment to prevention/intervention (Y→+).  
- **Z:** users are re-understood as subjects needing medical and social support; basic rights status is institutionally restored (Z→+).  
- **X:** resources shift from enforcement/incarceration to medical rehab and community support; cost–benefit structure reshuffles systemically.

The essence is shifting a long-underground, high-coercion governance object into an openly governable public-health object.
