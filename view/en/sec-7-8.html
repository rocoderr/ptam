### 8. Zionism

Zionism is one of the ideologies most easily misclassified—and most easily handled emotionally—in contemporary politics. It is often forced into oppositional frames such as “colonialism / anti-colonialism”, “Left / Right”, and “woke / anti-woke”. But these frames are **insufficient to explain its actual structure**.

From the three-axis perspective, Zionism is not a single point. It is a spectrum of ideological forms organized around **national survival, security, and state-building**. Its intense contemporary controversy is not because it is “new”, but because on multiple axes it has **high tension with Wokeism while not sharing Wokeism’s rights-ontology logic**.

#### 8.1 A necessary clarification: Zionism is not Wokeism

Before classification, one sentence must be made clear:

**Zionism is not part of Wokeism.**

The reason is straightforward:

- Wokeism’s basic path is: **identity → rights → institutional obligations**  
- Zionism’s basic path is: **national survival → security → state sovereignty**  

The former centers on rewriting rights ontology; the latter centers on the state as a rights-bearing structure. On the Rights Ontology Axis (Z), these two logics stand in **opposite directional tension**.

#### 8.2 Secular state-building Zionism: the state prior to identity politics

Early Zionist forms were not organized around an oppression narrative. They were organized around a practical problem:

**how to secure national survival under long-term absence of state protection.**

This type emphasizes:

- a sovereign state as the institutional precondition of security and rights;  
- rights are not generated directly from identity, but realized through state order.

Structurally:

- Z: leans toward Z+ (rights are treated as pre-political and requiring state protection, rather than identity-generated rights that constrain institutions)  
- Y: often allows internal pluralism and political disagreement; it does not rely on moralized compression of refusal space as the primary mechanism  
- X: not fixed; it can pair with social-democratic or market economic programs

This is a typical state-building ideology, not Identity Politics.

#### 8.3 Security–national Zionism: axis tightening under long conflict

As regional conflict becomes prolonged, some Zionist forms shift from “founding the state” to “continuous security”.

Typical features:

- the state is treated as the only realistic guarantee of national survival;  
- security receives high priority;  
- tolerance for external threats declines.

Axis effects:

- Y: tends to tighten under security narratives (coercion boundaries expand; some liberties are treated as acceptable tradeoffs)  
- Z: remains on the right in its core logic: rights are still understood as realized through state order, not generated directly from identity; it does not drift toward Z− in the Woke sense

This is one key reason for the fundamental tension between Zionism and Wokeism.

#### 8.4 Religious Zionism: a supra-political anchor of rights and obligation

Another important branch binds Zionism deeply to religious belief:

- land and statehood carry theological meanings;  
- the state is not only a security instrument, but part of a mission;  
- some sources of rights and obligations lie beyond secular politics.

On Z, this is not a move toward Z−. It is closer to **bypassing the secular left–right opposition on Z** by anchoring legitimacy in sacred order. This makes it neither Wokeism nor secular liberalism, but a supra-political authority–anchored ideology.

#### 8.5 Why Zionism is often forcibly re-coded through a Woke lens today

In contemporary discourse, Zionism is often recoded as: colonizer, oppressor, representative of structural privilege. This is not accidental. It reflects Woke narrative’s tendency to use a single Oppressor–Oppressed Lens to recode diverse conflicts.

Under that lens:

- state security becomes “structural violence”;  
- national self-determination becomes “colonial expansion”;  
- historical complexity is compressed into a moral binary.

The problem is not whether specific policies can be criticized. The problem is that critique is often forced into an ideological framework whose rights ontology is incompatible with Zionism’s core logic—producing systematic misclassification.

#### 8.6 Section summary: why it is highly contested yet cannot be simplified

Zionism remains highly contested not because it can be placed cleanly on “Left / Right”, but because:

- on Z it rejects the identity-directly-generates-rights path;  
- on Y it shows complex tensions under security contexts;  
- in contemporary narratives it is forcibly pulled into Woke moral framing.

This makes it a contemporary ideological case that cannot be simplified, yet cannot be avoided.
