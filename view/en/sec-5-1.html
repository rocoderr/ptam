### 1. Background Conditions

Background Conditions refer to contextual factors—such as security risks, historical trauma, resource pressures, and technological constraints—that change the frequency of political claims, the agenda weights attached to issues, and the path of institutional evolution. They do not constitute political positions. They are not Overlay Variables. They are used only as background analysis.

Background Conditions can be grouped into the following types:

**1. Technology and Media Environment**
- communication structure: broadcast media era vs platform–algorithmic media era  
- surveillance and encryption availability  
- attention competition and recommendation dynamics  
- techno-infrastructure of economy and governance (financial infrastructure, payment systems, data governance, etc.)  

**2. Security and Geopolitical Context**
- war vs peace; Cold War–style confrontation vs multipolar competition  
- terrorism and security pressure  
- mass migration and refugee flows  
- energy security and critical supply chains  
- international sanctions, alliance systems, and external institutional constraints  

**3. Historical Memory and Institutional Legacies**
- colonial and de-colonial legacies  
- memories of civil war, revolution, and mass mobilization  
- authoritarian past and transition legacies  
- collective trauma and securitization tendencies  

**4. Socio-demographic Structures**
- demographic structure: aging, youth share, population mobility  
- education and skill structure  
- urbanization, housing structure, and spatial segregation  
- inequality patterns and degree of stratification
