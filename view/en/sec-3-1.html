### 1. Economic Order Axis: From “Economic Variables” to the First Main Axis

In modern political history, one of the most stable anchors of “Left / Right” does come from the economic domain. Whether in disputes about class and distribution or disputes about property and markets, public language repeatedly returns to familiar oppositions: market vs planning, private vs public, low tax/low welfare vs high tax/high welfare, free competition vs industrial policy. These surface issues differ, but their target is highly consistent: the basic organizational form of economic activity.

#### 1.1 Main-axis definition: what question does it answer?

The Economic Order Axis studies how resources, capital, and factors of production are organized, allocated, and controlled. Its core is not a policy checklist, but structural questions:

- How are property rights arranged? (who has ultimate disposition rights)  
- How are resources allocated? (price signals or centralized decision)  
- How are production and exchange coordinated? (spontaneous order or directive coordination)  
- How are output and surplus distributed and redistributed? (market return or political/social goals)  

Therefore, this axis is not a “capitalism axis / socialism axis”, and it is not a value judgment about any particular system. It describes a spectrum of economic organizational forms. We summarize it as the Economic Order Axis.

#### 1.2 Direction and midpoint: what do − and + mean?

For positioning, we denote the two directions of the Economic Order Axis as negative (−) and positive (+):

- **Left side of X (X−)**: emphasizes public/collective ownership, planning or directive coordination, and state-led organization of economic order; redistribution and social goals are treated as important allocation rules.  
- **Right side of X (X+)**: emphasizes private property, market allocation, spontaneous order, and market returns as the primary allocation rule.  
- **Midpoint of X (X0)**: not “half and half” as an attitude, but a mixed-economy positioning: it recognizes both the allocative function of markets and the state’s role in rules, public goods, and redistribution. The key is “who leads, and up to what boundary”.

#### 1.3 Sub-axes: why use Sub-axes to operationalize?

The main axis provides an abstract question; Sub-axes provide handles for positioning. The Economic Order Axis can be expanded through the following Sub-axes because, in real disputes, it repeatedly appears through several stable facets:

| Category | Variables (Left − vs Right +) |
| :------: | :---------------------------- |
| Overall | planning vs market |
| Allocation mechanism sub-axis | planned economy vs market economy<br>planned allocation vs market allocation<br>directive coordination vs market coordination<br>centralized allocation vs decentralized decisions |
| Ownership structure sub-axis | public ownership vs private ownership<br>public property rights vs private property rights<br>collective/common property rights vs private property rights |
| Enterprise structure sub-axis | private-enterprise dominance vs state-owned-enterprise dominance |
| Role-of-the-state sub-axis | state-led development vs spontaneous market order<br>industrial policy first vs free competition first |
| Distribution and redistribution sub-axis | redistribution first vs property-rights priority<br>high tax vs low tax<br>high welfare vs low welfare |
| Externalities and public-goods sub-axis | directive emission cuts and strong regulation vs market-based emission cuts and weak regulation<br>quotas/bans first vs pricing/trading first<br>environmental targets first vs property rights and price signals first |
| Fairness criteria sub-axis (often activated economically) | equality of outcome vs equality of opportunity<br>substantive fairness vs procedural fairness<br>equity vs equality |

Sub-axes do not need to be perfectly synchronized. For example, someone may support market allocation and private property while also supporting relatively strong redistribution. This is not a flaw of the model; it is a mixed combination within the same main axis.

#### 1.4 Positioning method: how to position a stance on this axis

In practice, you can position from “hard structure” to “soft structure”:

1. Start with property rights and control rights (hardest): how strong is the commitment to the inviolability of private property? Are public/collective arrangements treated as exceptions or as principles?  
2. Then look at the allocation mechanism (most central): is the price mechanism treated as the main coordination method, or is centralized decision treated as superior?  
3. Then look at distribution rules (most contested): is redistribution treated as a corrective mechanism, or as a systemic disturbance to property rights and incentives?  
4. Finally look at the role of the state (most narrative-prone): is the state a “night-watchman-style rule-setter”, or a “developmental organizer”?

Here, “positioning” is an explanatory choice, not measurement scoring. It provides a comparable coordinate, not a moral evaluation.
