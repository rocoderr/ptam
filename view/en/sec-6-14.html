### 14. Fascism

In this chapter, Fascism is treated as an ideal type whose structural core is total mobilization, leader authority, and priority of the state–community. It often takes nationalism as a strong Overlay Variable, but the key is not merely nationalist sentiment; it is its extreme answers on Y/Z, and the resulting institutional logic that “rights-holders can be rewritten”.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: commonly midpoint-to-left (X0/X−) (markets and private ownership can exist, but economic order more strongly submits to state goals; allocation becomes more politicized)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Strong Left (Y−) (coercion boundaries expand sharply; total mobilization and order prioritized)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: Strong Left (Z−) (rights are highly institutionalized and subordinate to community purposes; the definition of rights-holders can be politically rewritten)  

**Structural core**

Its structural core lies in Y/Z: it organizes community and mobilization by expanding coercion boundaries and rewriting rights-holders; economic order is instrumentalized to serve state goals (Instrumentalized Market).

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- rights are more likely to undergo Rights Downgrade into Institutional Rights that can be suspended, excepted, or conditionalized.  
- Membership-Based Rights are reinforced; rights-holders and community boundaries are rewritten through politicization.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Nationalism / Internationalism  
- Centralization or Totalitarianism / Democratic Checks and Balances  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- war, economic crisis, and state failure: strong mobilization and order narratives more easily gain legitimacy in crisis.  
- group fear and identity anxiety: as identity conflict intensifies, rights rewriting on the Z-left (Z−) becomes more likely.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Public semantics often bind Fascism to “the Right” mainly because of overlay-level nationalism, anti-parliamentarism, and anti-liberalism narratives. But structurally it is not the classic right-wing combination of “market—small government—Natural Rights”. Its core is closer to extreme positions on Y− and Z−.
