### 3. Critical Race Theory (CRT)

Within this paper’s framework, Critical Race Theory (CRT) is better treated as a special Cognitive Lens: it provides a stable explanatory entry structure, and in public politics it is often “tool-ified” and generates institutional templates. It is singled out here not because it is “more important”, but because it more readily completes the real-world conversion from explanation to execution than most other lenses.

#### 3.1 Why it is a “special lens”

Compared with the lenses listed above, CRT’s distinctive feature is that it simultaneously contains three layers, and transitions between these layers are common in real politics:

- **an academic explanatory framework**: centered on law and institutions, explaining how racialization produces persistent differences through rules, standards, and institutional inertia;  
- **a public argumentative grammar**: more often treating outcome disparities as signals that require explanation and correction, rather than treating formally neutral rules as sufficient sources of legitimacy;  
- **an organizational governance toolbox**: more readily implemented inside organizations as executable mechanisms—training, evaluation, hiring, and disciplinary measures—thereby turning argumentative grammar into procedures and rules.  

These three layers make it a highly portable entry structure: once the same facts enter this lens, problem definition, actor setting, attribution, and evidence weights are often systematically reordered.

#### 3.2 Typical pulls on the three axes (directional, not definitional)

If we translate CRT as a lens into the three-axis language, its most stable pull is usually on the Rights Ontology Axis (Z):

- **Z (Rights Ontology Axis)**: it is more likely to treat rights as Institutional Rights, and to allow asymmetric adjustments to rights and rules for corrective purposes; therefore it often pulls disputes toward Z−.  

When it enters the “organizational governance toolbox” layer, the pull is more likely to spill over onto the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y):

- **Y (Liberty Boundary Axis)**: once corrective goals are written into executable mechanisms, disputes immediately arise about what tools can be normalized, and where boundaries should be drawn—thereby triggering Y-axis disagreement.  

On the Economic Order Axis (X), CRT often does not yield a single fixed conclusion: it can combine with different economic-order claims, so it should not be positioned as a “complete ideology package”.

#### 3.3 A minimal identification method: what to look for in materials

When analyzing materials, three signals can help identify whether the CRT lens is dominating the entry structure:

- does the explanatory focus shift from individual prejudice to rules, standards, and institutional inertia?  
- does attribution and legitimation treat outcome disparities as priority signals requiring explanation and correction?  
- does discussion naturally slide toward organizational tools and execution procedures (training, evaluation, discipline, and resource-allocation rules), thereby triggering boundary disputes?
