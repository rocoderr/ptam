### 4. Institutional Stability Domain (ISD)

#### 4.1 The basic idea

> The Institutional Stability Domain is the intersection of the low-risk intervals on the three ontological axes.  
> It denotes the space of institutional combinations that, along the dimensions of economic order, liberty boundary, and rights ontology, simultaneously satisfy “workable, correctable, sustainable”.

It is not a point, but a three-dimensional region of long-term institutional stability.

#### 4.2 A unified scale for the three axes

Under this model:

- each axis ranges in `[-5, +5]`  
- `0` = mixed / ambiguous / not yet crystallized  
- negative values = state/coercion/political definition  
- positive values = market/liberty/rights prior to politics

#### 4.3 Low-risk intervals on each axis

(1) X: Economic Order Axis

- extreme-risk zones:  
  - `X ≤ −3` (high planning / politicized resources)  
  - `X ≥ +4` (laissez-faire market / monopoly and public-goods failure)  
- **low-risk (stable) interval:** `X ∈ [+1, +3]`

Meaning:

- market-led  
- state provides anti-monopoly, rules, public goods  
- not “farthest right”, but “stable right”

(2) Y: Liberty Boundary Axis

- extreme-risk zones:  
  - `Y ≤ −3` (high coercion / order overwhelms liberty)  
  - `Y ≥ +4` (rule breakdown / externalities out of control)  
- **low-risk (stable) interval:** `Y ∈ [+1, +3]`

Meaning:

- liberty as default  
- coercion as exception  
- coercion must be proceduralized and accountable

(3) Z: Rights Ontology Axis

- extreme-risk zones:  
  - `Z ≤ −2` (rights politicized and revocable)  
  - `Z ≥ +4` (rights absolutized; governance incapacity)  
- **low-risk (stable) interval:** `Z ∈ [+2, +3]`

Meaning:

- rights prior to politics, universal, symmetric  
- institutions only carry, and cannot reverse-define  
- conflicts adjudicated via procedure and proportionality

Note: the stable interval on the Z axis is closer to the right and narrower. This is an important theoretical conclusion.

#### 4.4 Definition of ISD

In mathematical language:

> `ISD = { (X, Y, Z) | X ∈ [1,3], Y ∈ [1,3], Z ∈ [2,3] }`

This is an approximately rectangular three-dimensional region.

              ╱ │

```

Caption:

- Institutional stability is not at any single axis endpoint. It exists in the overlapping volume of the three axes’ low-risk intervals.  
- Institutional stability is not a stance, but an operable interval under multi-dimensional constraints.  
- Under the three-axis risk framework, political disorder does not come from values themselves, but from institutional paths deviating away from the stable volume.  
- Political crises are not “value conflicts as such”. They occur when institutional trajectories deviate away from that volume.

#### 4.6 Three high-risk trajectories as motions in 3D space

##### (1) The French Revolution

**Initial state (early 1789):**

- `X ≈ +1` (breaking guild and aristocratic economic privileges)  
- `Y ≈ 0 ~ +1` (liberty slogans, but order still holds)  
- `Z ≈ +1` (natural-rights declarations, but not stabilized)

→ near the edge of ISD, but not yet inside.

**Radicalization path (1792–1794, Jacobins):**

- `Z: +1 → −3` (rights are politically redefined into “people / counter-revolutionaries”)  
- `Y: +1 → −4` (terror rule, extraordinary laws, comprehensive coercion)  
- `X: +1 → −2` (price controls, political intervention in the economy)

Trajectory feature:

From the edge of the stable zone, it falls rapidly toward `Z−` and `Y−`. The rights-ontology judgment flips.

##### (2) Communism

**Theoretical starting point:**

- `Z: −5` (rights defined by class and historical mission)  
- `X: −5` (comprehensive planned economy)  
- `Y: −4 ~ −5` (high coercion; revolutionary dictatorship)

Trajectory features:

- it begins almost entirely outside ISD  
- it enters high-risk zones on all three axes simultaneously  
- there is no phase that “passes through the stable volume”

Graphically: it falls directly into the “risk deep well” of 3D space.

##### (3) Contemporary Woke / Identity-based Radicalism

**Discursive starting point (surface claims):**

- `Z (claimed): +3` (human rights, dignity, anti-discrimination)  
- `Y (claimed): +3` (self-identification, freedom of expression)  
- `X`: unstable (often `+1 ~ 0`)

**Actual institutional path (in practice):**

- `Z (substantive): +3 → −2` (rights redistributed by identity; “exception groups” appear)  
- `Y: +3 → −1` (language, speech, and behavior are coercively normed)  
- `X: +1 → −1` (quotas, compensation, institutional intervention)

Trajectory features:

- it cuts from the stable zone on `Z+` into the risk zone on `Z−`  
- it still uses “rights language” on the surface  
- ontologically it shifts to “politics defines rights”

#### 4.7 Summary tables

**Multi-Axis Political Models × ISD stability criteria**

| Axis | Axis meaning | Extreme risk (negative) | Extreme risk (positive) | ISD stable interval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| X (Economic Order) | market vs state | planning failure; politicized resources | monopoly; public-goods failure | +1 ~ +3 |
| Y (Liberty Boundary) | liberty vs coercion | despotism; fear-based order | rule failure; externalities | +1 ~ +3 |
| Z (Rights Ontology) | prior-to-politics vs constructed | rights revocable | governance incapacity | +2 ~ +3 |

**Institution quick-lookup examples**

| Institutional form | Can it fall into ISD? | Key reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constitutional representative democracy | ✔ yes | rights prior to politics + procedural filtering |
| non-constitutional democracy | △ unstable | majorities can erode rights |
| direct democracy | ✘ no | rights can be voted away |
| revolutionary dictatorship | ✘ no | rights politicized |
| technocracy | △ conditional | depends on Z-axis constraints |
