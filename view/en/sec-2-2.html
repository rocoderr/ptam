### 2. 1789: “Left / Right” in the French Revolution—Legitimacy of Estates vs Legal Equality

Keywords: parliamentary seating → shorthand for political stance.

- **Main conflict**: the legitimacy of the monarchic, clerical, and aristocratic estate order.  
- **“Left”** (roughly): anti-privilege, legal equality, expansion of citizenship.  
- **“Right”** (roughly): defense of estates and authority structures; protection of the existing order.  

The key point in this phase is that “Left / Right” first functioned as a language of legitimacy about political authority and social hierarchy. It was not the same thing as a later “bundle of economic policy positions”.

In other words, in its original context, “Left / Right” was closer to a shorthand for how the political community should be organized by status: who has political standing, who is excluded, and how authority is justified. These questions can of course connect to wealth, class, and institutional interests, but they are not equivalent to later economic disagreements such as “market vs planning” or “capital vs labor”. Treating “Left / Right in 1789” as a direct definition of contemporary Left / Right creates the first layer of conceptual misplacement.
