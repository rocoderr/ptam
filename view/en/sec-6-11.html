### 11. Capitalism

In this chapter, Capitalism refers to an ideal type whose economic-order core is “private property + market allocation + coordination primarily driven by price signals”, not an evaluation of real-world capitalist systems.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: Strong Right (X+) (private property, market allocation, spontaneous order)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: not necessary; commonly midpoint-to-right (Y0/Y+) (tends to limit expansion of public coercion into the economic and private domains). Under Background Conditions such as war, public-order threats, or other social crises, Y positioning can be pulled leftward (toward Y−).  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: not necessary; commonly midpoint-to-right (Z0/Z+) (Property Rights and Contract Rights are often treated as strong-boundary rights and lean toward Natural Rights; rights more strongly constrain politics)  

**Structural core**

Capitalism primarily targets X-type questions: it delegates allocation and incentives to market order, and limits the state more to rule-setting, private property protection, and dispute adjudication.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Property Rights and Contract Rights are often treated as basic rights, closer to a Z+ “prior boundary” understanding; therefore expropriation, regulation, and redistribution are usually required to provide stronger justification and procedural constraints.  
- Membership-Based Rights and Group/Identity Rights are more often treated as Institutional Rights, adjustable with social goals and institutional arrangements; therefore on Z they are closer to the midpoint (Z0).  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- community boundaries: Nationalism / Internationalism  
  - pull mechanism: when nationalism strengthens, trade and industrial policy more easily shifts toward protection and national goals, pulling X from the right (X+) toward the midpoint; when border governance and security narratives rise, Y is more likely to drift leftward.  
  - if membership is tightened, Z can drift toward midpoint-to-left (Z0/Z−).  
- justificatory basis of rights: Religion / Secularization  
  - pull mechanism: when religious tradition strengthens “rights are prior” narratives, Z moves closer to the right (Z+); when secular and institutional-construction narratives dominate, Z moves closer to the midpoint (Z0).  
  - effects on X are usually weaker; the main impact is on Z’s justificatory basis.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- Technological Conditions and Industrial Structure: when mobility of technology and capital rises, feasibility of market coordination increases, expanding the practical space for X+. Under resource pressure or mass unemployment shocks, X more easily shows short-term pullback toward the midpoint (X0).  
- Security Risks: when security risks rise significantly, Y is more likely to drift leftward, but this drift does not necessarily change the core X positioning.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Because Capitalism is centered on X, it does not determine directions on Y/Z: people who support markets can split sharply on speech, policing, immigration, war, and identity rights. Public semantics that equate “Capitalism = Right” are often historical projections of X+ bundled with certain Overlay Variables, not necessary bindings on the three axes.
