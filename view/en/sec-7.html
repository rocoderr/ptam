## VII. Contemporary Ideology Analysis

In this chapter, “contemporary ideologies” does not mean different branches within the same intellectual tradition. It refers to **typical ideological forms that, in contemporary politics, have strong mobilizing power, strong institutional influence, and high controversy intensity**.

Some of these ideologies—such as antiracism, contemporary feminism, gender politics, and anti-colonialism—share highly similar structural features in contemporary politics: they tend to use **identity or historical condition to generate rights boundaries directly**, and then exert sustained pressure on institutions and the space of liberty. This book calls this group of structurally isomorphic ideologies the **Wokeism family**.

But this chapter is not identical to a “Wokeism chapter”.

Environmentalism, Animal Protectionism, and Zionism do not originate from Wokeism’s rights-ontology logic, and they do not necessarily share the “identity → rights → institutional obligations” path. They are included here because they are also **unavoidable ideological forces in contemporary politics**, and they exert deep impacts on institutions and society in three-axis structure.

One more point requires explicit emphasis: in contemporary public discourse, the Oppressor–Oppressed Lens preferred by Wokeism is being widely used to reinterpret many political conflicts that did not originate from Wokeism. In this sense, ideologies such as Zionism and Environmentalism become entangled with Wokeism at the level of narrative, rather than sharing a common ontological origin.

The analytic goal of this chapter is not to force these ideologies into one camp, but to use the **Economic Order Axis (X), Liberty Boundary Axis (Y), and Rights Ontology Axis (Z)** to explain:

- how they shift, generate tensions, and collide across different axes;  
- why they are so often misclassified, simplified, or handled emotionally in contemporary politics.  

In other words, the focus is:

**how different ideologies today reshape institutional boundaries, the space of liberty, and the way rights are understood.**
