### 3. Anarchism

In this chapter, Anarchism refers to an ideal type whose core is “opposition to the state monopoly on coercion, opposition to hierarchical domination, and emphasis on autonomy and voluntary cooperation”. Its concern is not whether the state is efficient, but whether coercive power is centralized into a default social order.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: Left (X−) (leans toward voluntary cooperation in communes/mutual aid; opposes both capital concentration and the monopoly of state planning)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Strong Right (Y+) (rejects the state monopoly on coercion; emphasizes maximal autonomy)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: not necessary; common split (Z−/Z+) (one branch leans Natural Rights; another leans an anti-domination reconstruction closer to Institutional Rights)  

**Structural core**

The structural core of Anarchism sits on the Y axis: it rejects concentrating coercion as a stable source of public order, and seeks to build social cooperation on voluntariness and autonomy.  
Minimal scenario: a community runs public affairs via a members’ assembly and self-governance rules; disputes are resolved through mediation and negotiation, rather than state enforcement.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Personal Liberty Rights and Freedom of Assembly and Association Rights are more likely to be treated as inalienable basic rights.  
- Membership-Based Rights and Group/Identity Rights are more likely to be treated as exit-able and negotiable cooperative relations, rather than high-weight exclusion boundaries.  

**Overlay Variable notes**

- Revolution / Reform  
  - pull mechanism: when revolutionary narratives rise, organization and mobilization more readily tilt toward high-intensity confrontation; reform paths emphasize expanding autonomy within the cracks of existing institutions.  
- Social Engineering / Spontaneous Order  
  - pull mechanism: emphasizing spontaneous order treats autonomy as emergent cooperation; emphasizing social engineering more readily produces standardized self-governance rules and organizational discipline.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- breakdown of state legitimacy and memories of state violence: when coercion is seen as the primary risk source, the Y+ positioning becomes more stable.  
- density of grassroots self-governance organizations: the denser cooperatives, unions, and community organizations are, the more feasible voluntary cooperation becomes.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Anarchism is often misread as “anti-order” or “no rules”, but what it opposes is concentration of coercion and hierarchical domination—not social cooperation itself. Its internal tensions focus on how self-governance forms enforceable public rules, and how individual liberty is balanced with community cooperation.
