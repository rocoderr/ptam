### 5. A Summary Table for Left–Right Classification

| Within-Axis Descriptor | Axis Score | X: Economic Order Axis<br>(Market vs State) | Y: Liberty Boundary Axis<br>(Liberty vs Coercion) | Z: Rights Ontology Axis<br>(Natural Rights vs Institutional Rights) |
| :-------------------: | :--------: | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Far Right | +4 to +5 | **Markets absolutely dominate**; private property is inviolable; prices and voluntary exchange are the only legitimate mechanisms; denies the legitimacy of state economic allocation (at +5, denies public economic order itself) | **Individual liberty absolutely dominates**; public coercion is tolerated only as a fact, not as legitimate (at +5, denies any legitimacy of public coercion) | **Rights have an absolute and non-yielding prior status**; exceptions are, in principle, unacceptable (at +5, institutions lose legitimacy if they infringe rights) |
| Strong Right | +3 | Markets clearly dominate; private property is central; the state is limited to a “night-watchman” role (contracts, policing, courts) | Liberty is strongly prioritized; state power is strictly limited and must not extend into moral or private-life domains | Rights are prior and have veto power; only very few exceptions with extremely high thresholds are allowed |
| Right | +2 | Markets dominate but limited regulation is accepted; the state intervenes only under clear market failure; ownership is primarily private with limited public ownership | Liberty is the default; specific public coercion requires strict justification and narrow scope | Rights are treated as prior in principle, but can be weakened in extreme public-risk situations |
| Slight Right | +1 | Markets remain dominant; some public sector and rules are accepted; state participation is marginal and rule-based | Individual liberty remains dominant; limited, explicit, and appealable public coercion is allowed | Rights lean toward being prior, but in practice rely on institutional protection |
| Neutral | 0 | **Markets and the state have roughly comparable weight in allocation**; price mechanisms and administrative allocation coexist; dominance is unclear or intentionally balanced; mixed public–private ownership | **Liberty and coercion are balanced**; public intervention and individual autonomy are in institutional equilibrium | **Rights are neither absolutely prior nor purely constructed**; they are balanced as institutional principles |
| Slight Left | −1 | The state increases regulation and redistribution; markets persist but become secondary | Public coercion expands into economic and security domains (regulation, obligations, licensing) | Rights are more often understood as outcomes of institutional recognition and protection |
| Left | −2 | The state leads allocation of key resources; markets exist but are instrumentalized and subordinated; private property is systemically constrained | Individual choice is broadly intervened in to achieve public goals; public coercion expands into expression, employment, organization, and other domains | Rights are treated as redefinable and negotiable political constructs |
| Strong Left | −3 | The state becomes the primary allocator; markets are only auxiliary tools | Strong state; coercion is normalized; individual liberty systematically yields across many domains | Rights systematically yield, in practice, to justice/equality/order |
| Far Left | −4 to −5 | **The state or collective absolutely dominates**; planning and rationing become normal replacements for markets (at −5, denies the legitimacy of market allocation); public or collective ownership is absolutely dominant | **Comprehensive coercion**; denies an independent status for individual liberty | **Denies any prior or constraining significance of rights**; rights language is treated as a tool or an illusion |
