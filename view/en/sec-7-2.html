### 2. Structural Antiracism

In contemporary politics, antiracism is not a single stance, but a spectrum with large internal differences. The focus here is not the broad consensus against racial discrimination, but **how three-axis positioning changes when antiracism takes “structural oppression” as its core explanatory framework and further develops into an institutional reconstruction program of rights**.

In its Wokeism-ized form, antiracism no longer merely demands symmetric application of law and institutions. Through a structural interpretation of historical injustice, it turns certain group positions into continuous sources of rights legitimacy, and pushes for asymmetric rights allocation and expansion of institutional obligations. This section distinguishes different antiracist paths and explains their divergence on the Rights Ontology Axis.

First, one point must be stated clearly:

**Opposing racial discrimination is not, by itself, Wokeism.**

For a long time, antiracism’s core claim was straightforward: do not treat people differently by race; do not deprive opportunity by skin color; apply law and institutions equally to all. In that form, it did not introduce a new rights-ontology assumption. It demanded that existing rights rules be executed. Therefore, it can be—and historically has been—absorbed into liberalism.

The structural transformation begins when “structural” becomes central.

#### 2.1 From “discriminatory acts” to “structural oppression”: how the problem is rewritten

A key turn in contemporary antiracism is moving from specific discriminatory acts to persistent group outcome disparities. The rewrite often follows three steps:

1) no longer asking mainly “did someone discriminate against you”;  
2) asking instead “do persistent outcome gaps exist between groups”;  
3) further assuming: if gaps exist, the structure itself is problematic.  

This by itself is not necessarily Wokeism. The decisive boundary appears in the next step: whether outcome gaps are converted into ongoing rights justification and into institutional duties that constrain refusal space.

#### 2.2 Three typical paths: equal protection, structural diagnosis, and rights reconstruction

To avoid collapsing different arguments into one label, we can separate three typical paths. They can coexist or blend, but they differ structurally:

**Path A: Equal-protection antiracism (rule-internal)**  
This path stays within a liberal-rights grammar: fix discriminatory acts, enforce equal rules, and improve procedural fairness. It does not require rewriting the ontology of rights-holders.

- Z: typically closer to Z0/Z+ (rights are universalized; identity is not itself a rights boundary)  
- Y: typically closer to Y0/Y+ (coercion expansion is justified mainly by procedure and due process)  
- X: not fixed (can combine with different economic positions)

**Path B: Structural-diagnosis antiracism (mechanism-first)**  
This path makes “structure” central, but keeps the demand for testable mechanisms: it asks *how* institutions produce disparities (incentives, gatekeeping, network effects, geographic sorting, policing patterns, etc.), and then targets those mechanisms with bounded reforms.

- Z: often Z0 (acknowledges universal rights boundaries, but allows some institutional adjustments)  
- Y: often Y0 (interventions are justified, but should remain procedurally bounded and revisable)  
- X: not fixed

**Path C: Rights-reconstruction antiracism (Wokeism-ized)**  
This path turns group position and historical injustice into ongoing legitimacy sources for asymmetric rights allocation, and treats refusal to adopt that asymmetry as a rights violation. It tends to convert moral narratives into institutional obligations across organizations and platforms.

- Z: tends to drift toward Z− (rights are treated as Institutionally constructed and adjustable for “correction”, often with asymmetry)  
- Y: tends to drift toward Y− (enforcement expands; refusal space shrinks; enforcement often becomes distributed rather than state-only)  
- X: often couples with redistribution legitimacy, but remains less stable than Z/Y

#### 2.3 Where the core controversy actually sits

The most fundamental controversy is usually not “whether racism exists”. It is:

- whether group outcome disparities should be treated as default evidence of structural injustice;  
- whether “correction” justifies asymmetric institutional rules;  
- whether refusal counts as rights violation and therefore deserves consequence enforcement.  

In the three-axis language, this concentrates on Z (what counts as rights and who can claim them) and Y (how far coercion can go to enforce those claims). Economic arguments (X) often enter later as tool selection rather than as the root.
