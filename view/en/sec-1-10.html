### 10. What This Model Adds Beyond Existing Left–Right Models

Compared with a single-axis left–right spectrum and Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Models (such as the Nolan Chart and the Political Compass), the key advances of the Political Triple-Axis Model are:

1. Separating “economic order questions” from “coercion-boundary questions”;
2. Elevating the disagreement over whether rights exist prior to institutions into an independent main axis (the Rights Ontology Axis);
3. Distinguishing main axes from overlay variables, thereby explaining historical drift and cross-societal misuse of political labels.

The model targets three common forms of confusion:

1. Forcing different axes of disagreement into the same “Left / Right” label;
2. Treating overlay variables as new ontological axes;
3. Treating concrete policy bundles as the whole of a “structural stance.”

Analytical path: first position direction and proximity on the Economic Order Axis, Liberty Boundary Axis, and Rights Ontology Axis; then identify overlay variables; and finally explain why a particular policy bundle, discourse label, and alliance structure appears.

Scope limits: this is an explanatory model/framework. It does not predict elections, does not replace empirical research, does not provide policy-effect conclusions, and does not treat any country or era as a standard answer. In this paper, “Left / Right” are used only as direction symbols (Left = −, Right = +) and do not carry real-world camp meanings.
