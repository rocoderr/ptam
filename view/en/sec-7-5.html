### 5. Anti-colonialism (in Contemporary Woke Contexts)

Anti-colonialism is an important macro-level expansion of Wokeism along the dimension of history and global order. It extends the Oppressor–Oppressed framework from internal social relations to historical responsibility, civilizational narratives, and asymmetric international structures.

In its politicized form, anti-colonialism is not only a stance of historical reflection. Through group-based and historicized rights narratives, it turns past injustice into contemporary institutional obligations and legitimacy for redistribution. This section analyzes its pulls on the Rights Ontology Axis and the Economic Order Axis, and explains why it becomes one of the most macro-explanatory branches within Wokeism.

Anti-colonialism is not a new issue. What gives it renewed high mobilization power in contemporary politics is not rediscovering colonial history, but a deeper shift:

**colonialism is no longer treated as a past event, but is re-described as a still-operating structural relationship.**

Once anti-colonialism enters Woke contexts, the center shifts from “how to evaluate the past” to “who still bears responsibility today, and in what way”.

#### 5.1 Three paths: historical evaluation, structural continuity, and institutional obligation

Anti-colonialism can be analytically separated into three paths. They can mix, but their axis effects differ.

**Path A: colonialism as historical injustice (evaluation-focused)**  
The most moderate and most institutionally absorbable path treats colonialism as a concluded past wrong that requires recognition, apology, memorialization, and limited reparative measures.

- Z: often Z0/Z+ (keeps universal rights language; focuses on historical acknowledgement)  
- Y: often Y0 (bounded institutional actions)

**Path B: colonialism as a continuing structural relation (structure-focused)**  
This path treats global inequalities and international institutions as reproducing colonial asymmetries, and therefore treats decolonization as a continuing project.

- X: often pulls leftward when redistribution, development policy, or structural reforms are emphasized  
- Z/Y: can vary, depending on whether the program remains procedural or becomes enforcement-heavy

**Path C: colonialism as ongoing obligation and entitlement (Wokeism-ized)**  
In this path, historical position becomes a continuing source of rights legitimacy and entitlement; institutions are required to adopt ongoing corrective duties; refusal can be framed as rights violation.

- Z: tends to drift toward Z− (rights become historicalized, group-positioned, and institutionally adjustable)  
- Y: tends to drift toward Y− (enforcement expands, often through organizational and cultural mechanisms)  
- X: often couples with redistribution and resource-transfer legitimacy

#### 5.2 Why it becomes “macro-explanatory” in contemporary politics

Anti-colonialism is often attractive as a narrative because it offers a high-level causal frame that can “explain” diverse conflicts under one structure. In Woke contexts, it readily integrates with the Oppressor–Oppressed Lens, turning complex historical and geopolitical disputes into moralized binaries.

The analytic point here is not whether critique is allowed, but whether critique is being forced into a single lens that rewrites causality, evidence thresholds, and legitimacy allocation before disputes even enter X/Y/Z positioning.
