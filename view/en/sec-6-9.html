### 9. Liberalism

In this chapter, Liberalism mainly refers to a tradition that treats individuals as basic rights-holders, and grounds political legitimacy in constraining coercion boundaries and protecting rights.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: can range from midpoint to right (X0/X+) (Liberalism includes internal combinations from more market-leaning to more welfare-leaning)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Strong Right (Y+) (emphasizes shrinking coercion boundaries and strengthening procedural constraints)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: Strong Right (Z+) (leans toward Natural Rights, or at least acknowledges strong prior boundaries)  

**Structural core**

Liberalism is first a Y/Z tradition: it grounds political legitimacy in “coercion boundaries are constrained” and “rights-holders are universalized”, rather than starting from a particular economic policy package.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Freedom of Speech Rights, Due Process Rights, and Personal Liberty Rights are more likely to be treated as basic rights and placed behind strong prior boundaries.  
- Group/Identity Rights are more often treated as Institutional Rights, constrained by procedural and universality standards.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Nationalism / Internationalism  
  - pull mechanism: when nationalism strengthens, the weight of Membership-Based Rights rises and Z more readily retracts toward the midpoint; when internationalism strengthens, universal rights boundaries are emphasized more strongly.  
- Secular / Religious  
  - pull mechanism: when religious tradition strengthens, prior-rights narratives become stronger; when secularization strengthens, legitimacy of rights relies more on procedural institutions.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- rule-of-law traditions and separation-of-powers institutions: judicial independence and procedural stability are institutional supports for Y+.  
- density of market and civil-society organizations: the more developed intermediary structures are, the easier it is to sustain a shrinking coercion boundary.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Liberalism is most often conflated with “economic right”, but under the three-axis model it can ally with different X stances: there can be Liberalism at the midpoint-to-left (X0/X−) as well as Liberalism on the right (X+). Reducing Liberalism to “market supremacy” obscures its core (Y+ and Z+).
