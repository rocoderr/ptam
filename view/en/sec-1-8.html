### 8. How This Model Is Constructed

#### 8.1 Ontological Axes

To explain fundamental disagreements, a candidate variable should be treated as an ontological axis only if it simultaneously satisfies:

- Ontological Independence
- Orthogonality
- Structure-Generating Capacity (stable capacity to generate political order)
- Trans-historical Stability (a degree of stability across historical contexts)

#### 8.2 Overlay Variables

To explain why political claims with close three-axis positions display noticeable gaps, or why the gaps are small but their expressions differ (e.g., progressive vs conservative; national vs international; mass vs elite).

#### 8.3 Background Conditions (not part of the model; explanatory only)

Beyond overlay variables, some situational conditions—such as security risk, historical trauma, resource pressure, and technological conditions—can affect how frequently certain claims appear and how institutions evolve. But these are not political stances. They are not overlay variables. They are treated only as Background Conditions in analysis.

#### 8.4 Cognitive Lens (not part of the model; explanatory only)

This refers to upstream cognitive entry points before people enter concrete policy and institutional disputes. A cognitive lens defines the problem framing, relevant actors, and default attribution/legitimacy distribution, and shapes evidential salience. It does not participate in three-axis positioning, and it is neither an overlay variable nor a background condition.
