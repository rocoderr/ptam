## III. The Three Main Axes

We begin from familiar everyday experience: how people judge, in public discussion, whether “you lean left or right”, and why those judgments often conflict with each other. This chapter then decomposes those messy judgments into three ontological axes that are symmetric in abstraction level, mutually irreducible, and non-substitutable: the Economic Order Axis, the Liberty Boundary Axis, and the Rights Ontology Axis.

Public political talk contains many paired oppositions—two opposite or contrasting terms—and these pairs are often labeled as “Left / Right”. For convenience, this paper calls each such pair a “political variable” or simply a “variable”. Variables can repeat, intersect, or describe the same tension using different phrases, which creates confusion. By de-duplicating and merging these variables, we form the three main axes of this model. The remaining variables are handled in the next chapter as Overlay Variables.
