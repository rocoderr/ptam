### 2. Expanding normalized surveillance powers in the name of public safety

#### 2.1 Initial Position: privacy as a coercively protected personal boundary

In most modern liberal-democratic systems, privacy is treated as a basic right not easily violated. The default structure includes:

- **Z:** location, communications, identity information, and personal data are treated as pre-political boundaries; access and use must be strictly limited and justified (Z+).  
- **Y:** state collection/surveillance is allowed only in specific, case-based situations with clear legal authorization and procedural safeguards; surveillance is a highly exceptional coercive tool (Y+).  
- **X:** security equipment, data processing, and IT supply are mainly market-provided; state procurement/deployment is constrained by budget, legitimacy, and proportionality; no comprehensive governance infrastructure exists by default.

Under this structure, privacy is a key boundary limiting state coercion, and surveillance must be justified as exception, not routine.

#### 2.2 Contextual Scenario: sustained public-safety risk plus rising technical feasibility

This motion is often proposed under:

- crime/terrorism/instability described as sustained structural risks, not short anomalies;  
- technology makes large-scale video surveillance, data integration, and behavioral analysis feasible in cost and operation;  
- purely ex post investigation is seen as insufficient for high-consequence prevention; demand for “early detection and early intervention” rises.

The focus shifts from “allow surveillance or not” to whether surveillance should become **normalized governance** rather than an exception.

#### 2.3 Motion Statement

**When public-safety risks are treated as persistent, the state should expand video surveillance, data collection, and long-term retention to normalize monitoring of public space and individual behavior, improving public order and risk prevention.**

The core is re-ordering the priority between privacy and security goals, and front-loading what was previously a highly constrained coercive tool.

#### 2.4 Structural Consequences: privacy conditionalized; coercion boundary moves forward

- **Z:** privacy shifts from an inviolable pre-political boundary to a right conditionalized and collectively yielded under security goals (Z→−).  
- **Y:** the threshold for coercion entering information/behavior domains drops; monitoring becomes routine rather than case-based exception (Y→−).  
- **X:** security tech, data processing, and governance capacity become deeply bound to state procurement and public budgets, producing a tech–governance complex and supplier concentration.

This drift tends to be hard to reverse: once surveillance infrastructure and data systems exist, they rarely fully withdraw even if risk declines.
