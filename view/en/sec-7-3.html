### 3. Feminism

Feminism is not a single ideology. It is a family of intellectual and political-practice traditions that diverge sharply in rights ontology, coercion boundaries, and how they understand institutional obligations. This section avoids equating feminism as a whole with Wokeism. It instead **distinguishes which feminist paths remain centered on symmetric individual rights within a coherent framework, and which have entered an identity-structured, structure-centered, and coercion-amplifying rights logic**.

Using the three-axis model, this section shows the structural differences within feminism—from liberal-leaning approaches to radical and intersectional approaches—and explains how Wokeism can function as an “assembly mechanism” that absorbs and rewrites some feminist claims.

One easily confused point must be clarified first:

**Feminism is not a single stance, but a set of paths that differ sharply in where rights come from, what institutions should do, and how coercion is enforced.**

If feminism is understood only as “fighting for women’s rights”, it is neither new nor necessarily left. What determines its three-axis position is not “whether one supports women”, but **how rights are grounded and how they are enforced**.

#### 3.1 Rule-internal feminism: equal rights, but not necessarily left

A long-standing and still common path is direct:

- law should not discriminate by sex;  
- opportunity and qualification should compete under the same rules;  
- the problem is not the rules themselves, but failure to enforce them.

Structurally, this path has three features:

- Z: does not demand redefining what rights are; it demands that existing rights apply equally (often closer to Z0/Z+)  
- Y: typically favors procedural remedies and bounded institutional tools (often Y0/Y+)  
- X: not fixed; it can coexist with market-leaning or welfare-leaning economic positions

This is why “supporting women’s rights” does not automatically imply “Left” in any single-axis sense.

#### 3.2 Structural and radical feminism: when coercion and institutional obligations expand

Another path treats persistent gender disparities as structural domination that cannot be corrected by symmetric rules alone. Its typical moves include:

- shifting the explanatory center from individual acts to structural reproduction;  
- treating many “neutral” rules as vehicles of domination;  
- legitimating broader institutional duties (education, workplace governance, speech norms, risk-control policies).

When these moves become institutionalized, the axis pulls often look like:

- Z: toward Z− (rights are treated as institutional constructs that can be adjusted asymmetrically for correction)  
- Y: toward Y− (boundedness of coercion weakens, especially through organizational enforcement)  
- X: often couples with redistribution or public provision, but still not uniquely fixed

#### 3.3 Intersectionality as a structural assembly mechanism

When feminism is combined with multi-identity positioning (race, class, sexuality, disability, etc.), disputes more easily shift from “equal protection under one rule” to “rights boundaries generated by identity position”. This is one route by which Wokeism functions as an assembly mechanism: it offers an upstream entry structure and a ready-made enforcement grammar, so that different issue domains begin to share similar political mechanics.

#### 3.4 A practical diagnostic: “which path is it on now?”

If this section is read clearly, the analytic question shifts from “is feminism right or wrong?” to:

**which path is it taking in a given dispute?**

The decisive signals are:

- whether identity position is treated as a non-refusable rights boundary;  
- whether refusal is treated as rights violation;  
- whether consequence enforcement becomes normalized through institutions, platforms, or professional communities.
