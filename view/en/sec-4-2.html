### 2. Common Types of Overlay Variables

This paper classifies Overlay Variables by *the level at which they appear in political process*: value and time orientation, mobilization style, community boundaries, institutional and power structure, policy path and governance method, economic policy tools, and the justificatory basis of welfare claims. If one variable falls into multiple categories, use as the primary category the one that **directly changes the institutional mechanism**.

#### 2.1 Value and Time Orientation (Pace of Reform and Risk Preference)

**Typical variables:**
- progressive vs conservative  
- radical vs conservative  
- change vs stability  
- woke vs anti-woke  
- revolution vs reform  

**Example:**
- both sides endorse similar institutional reforms, but one emphasizes rapid advance and structural reshaping;  
- the other emphasizes gradual adjustment and institutional continuity.  

**When it does not directly change three-axis positioning:**
- the difference only shows up as agenda ordering, speed of policy rollout, or risk tolerance; no new institutional arrangements are introduced; e.g., property structure is unchanged, coercion boundaries are not expanded, and rights’ ontological status is not redefined;  
- in this case, three-axis positioning stays the same.  

**When it changes the *characteristics* of future positioning:**
- time orientation can produce very different rates of positional movement per unit time and different levels of institutional shock, triggering irreversible reforms, backlash, or path dependence;  
- even with the same reform direction, different pace can, through institutional inertia and lock-in, change the future reachable set of three-axis positions;  
- here the main effect is on speed, shock, and long-run path—not the initial direction.  

#### 2.2 Political Mobilization and Organizational Mode

**Typical variables:**
- mass mobilization vs elite bargaining  
- street politics vs parliamentary bargaining  
- emotional mobilization vs technocratic argument  
- populism vs elitism  
- “the people” vs bureaucracy  
- the masses vs elites  
- mass politics vs technocratic governance  

**Example:**
- in elections, one community relies more on large rallies and emotional mobilization;  
- the other relies more on intra-party bargaining, expert argumentation, and procedural deliberation.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- legislative procedure stays unchanged; the scope of administrative discretion is not expanded; judicial review is not weakened;  
- in this case, mobilization differences do not change economic organization, coercion boundaries, or rights ontology, so three-axis positioning stays the same.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- mobilization is institutionalized to justify bypassing procedures or concentrating power; for example, weakening parliamentary procedure in the name of “direct authorization by the people”; expanding administrative discretion in the name of urgent public opinion; continuously suppressing judicial constraints under mobilization pressure;  
- then coercion boundaries are redrawn, and the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) shifts left (toward Y−).  

#### 2.3 Political Community Boundaries and Identity

**Typical variables:**
- nationalism vs internationalism  
- sovereignty-first vs supranational governance  
- domestic governance vs supranational governance  
- domestic law supremacy vs constraint by international rules  
- secular vs religious  
- atheism vs God  
- open immigration vs restricted immigration  
- assimilationism vs multiculturalism  
- homogeneous identity vs plural identity  

Related concepts:
- salience of ethnic/racial boundaries  
- salience of language–region boundaries  
- salience of urban–rural segmentation  
- salience of generational segmentation  
- Identity Politics: the salience of “identity categories as organizing principles for political mobilization and rights claims” (to be distinguished from “identity rights” as a disputed object on the Rights Ontology Axis)  

**Example:**
- both sides endorse market order, but one emphasizes sovereignty-first and tightens immigration;  
- the other emphasizes constraint by international rules and multicultural integration.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- claims are limited to adjusting visa conditions, immigration quotas, or naturalization standards;  
- enforcement powers, surveillance tools, and judicial-review thresholds are not expanded;  
- coercion boundaries remain unchanged institutionally, so the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) does not move.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- identity boundaries are institutionalized into routine identity checks, expanded enforcement powers, or lowered standards for judicial review;  
- membership status and the rights status of members are systematically rewritten;  
- coercion expands into everyday life, and the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) shifts left (toward Y−).  

#### 2.4 Institutional and Power Structure

**Typical variables:**
- autocracy vs democracy  
- centralized/totalitarian rule vs democratic checks and balances  
- centralization vs decentralization  
- central vs local  
- direct democracy vs representative government  
- federalism vs unitary state  
- presidentialism vs parliamentarism  

**Example:**
- one country shifts fiscal and governance powers from local autonomy to centralized authority;  
- another increases local decision autonomy within a unified framework.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- changes are limited to organizational-level reshuffling or nominal renaming; judicial constraints, separation of powers, and rights boundaries remain unchanged;  
- the direction of three-axis positioning stays consistent.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- veto points are removed; judicial review is weakened; administrative discretion is expanded and normalized;  
- coercion boundaries are redrawn, and the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) shifts left (toward Y−).  

#### 2.5 Policy Path and Governance Method

**Typical variables:**
- present-first vs future-first  
- rationalism vs bounded rationality  
- social engineering vs spontaneous order  

**Example:**
- when facing environmental and debt problems, one side emphasizes present-first and immediate correction;  
- the other emphasizes future-first and phased pilots.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- differences appear only as evaluation criteria (short-term vs long-term), risk tolerance, or pilot-first preference; institutional structure is not rewritten;  
- property arrangements, coercion boundaries, and rights ontology remain unchanged.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- governance methods are institutionalized into long-term coercive planning or normalized intervention tools;  
- rules of resource allocation are reshaped, or coercion boundaries expand persistently;  
- the Economic Order Axis (X) and/or the Liberty Boundary Axis (Y) shifts.  

#### 2.6 Economic Policy Tool Orientation (Trade and Industrial Policy)

**Typical variables:**
- free-trade orientation vs protectionism orientation  

**Example:**
- one country uses temporary tariffs and subsidies to respond to a short-term external shock;  
- another fixes industrial structure through long-term tariffs, quotas, and industrial catalogs.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- tariffs and subsidies only adjust trading conditions within limited scope;  
- firms still decide mainly by market demand, costs, and competition; failed firms still exit the market;  
- the dominant economic organization remains market allocation, so the Economic Order Axis (X) does not change structurally.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- industrial policy and trade protection are institutionalized into: key conditions for firm entry and continued production; long-term guarantees against exit; primary determinants of technology path and output choice;  
- economic actors systematically respond to policy signals rather than price signals;  
- the economic organization changes, and the Economic Order Axis (X) shifts left (toward X−).  

#### 2.7 Justificatory Basis of Welfare Claims

**Typical variables:**
- welfare as policy arrangement vs welfare as rights claim  

**Example:**
- one side treats welfare as an adjustable policy tool;  
- the other treats welfare as a prior right that cannot be politically vetoed.  

**When it does not change three-axis positioning:**
- eligibility and standards are treated as legislative policy choices—adjustable and revocable, without veto power;  
- the ontological status of rights is not redefined, so the Rights Ontology Axis (Z) does not change.  

**When it changes three-axis positioning:**
- welfare is explicitly defined as a prior right that cannot be politically vetoed, or defined as a pure grant fully dependent on administrative discretion;  
- rights ontology shifts accordingly, and the Rights Ontology Axis (Z) moves.
