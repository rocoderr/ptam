### 4. Early 20th Century: Mass Mobilization and Extreme Experiences—“Left / Right” Shifts from Parliamentary Semantics to Camp Semantics

Keywords: mass party politics, mass mobilization, war and revolution.

Two changes happened in this phase:

- **Change A: the label use rose sharply**  
  “Left / Right” became more like a camp marker, and less like an analytic tool for issues.

- **Change B: historical memory created strong bindings**  
  Some political experiences (for example Fascism and authoritarian national mobilization) formed strong associations in European memory. This pushed the communicable mapping “national mobilization → authoritarian rule → right / far right” to become widely accepted.

One clarification is necessary: Nationalism / Internationalism does not automatically carry a stable view of rights or power. It is closer to a choice about the scale of political community and the scope of identification. In many 19th-century European contexts, nationalism often appeared as popular mobilization for sovereignty and national self-determination against empires and dynasties. Its “progressive” character did not necessarily fit later right-wing semantics. Treating “nation / international” as an ontological Left / Right divide is a mismatch of conceptual level. This will be handled more formally as an Overlay Variable later.

This phase can be summarized as a shift in the main arena of politics: it was no longer mainly persuasion and coalition-building inside parliaments, but organization, mobilization, and governance directed at mass publics. As mass mobilization became normal, “Left / Right” was more easily used as a low-cost identity signal, and it gained strong emotional coloring through experiences of war, revolution, and extreme rule. The historical memories produced here have a “sticky effect” on later classification: even when contexts change, labels tend to retain old association chains instead of returning to structural analysis.
