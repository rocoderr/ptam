### 7. Social Democracy

The typical aim of Social Democracy is to reduce inequality and risk exposure while retaining market mechanisms, by institutionalizing redistribution and public services, and embedding public power in procedural constraints.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: commonly left-to-midpoint (X−/X0) (mixed economy: market allocation + strong redistribution and public goods provision)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: commonly the midpoint (Y0) (public power is stronger, but constrained procedurally and revocable)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: commonly the midpoint (Z0) (acknowledges some prior rights boundaries while also valuing expansion of Institutional Rights)  

**Structural core**

The key is not “a bigger state”, but “a more institutionalized state”: it tries to carry redistribution and public services on X within a procedural framework at the Y-midpoint (Y0).

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Social Security Rights and Labor Rights are more likely to be treated as basic rights and institutionalized into predictable guarantees.  
- Property Rights and Contract Rights are still recognized, but their boundaries are often adjusted conditionally for public goals.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Change / Stability  
  - pull mechanism: emphasis on stability prioritizes procedure and incremental reform; emphasis on change can push policy expansion and intensify redistribution.  
- Mass Politics / Technocratic Governance  
  - pull mechanism: when mass politics intensifies, policy is more easily pulled by emotional mobilization; when technocratic governance intensifies, Y more easily stabilizes at the midpoint.  

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- high-tax / high-trust institutional environments: strong social trust and administrative capacity make institutionalized redistribution easier to sustain.  
- demographics and welfare burdens: aging and fiscal pressure can pull X back toward the midpoint (X0) or trigger disputes about policy adjustment.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Social Democracy is often misread as “necessarily leading to strong control”, but this usually confuses the Y-midpoint (Y0) with the left side (Y−): both involve stronger public power, but Social Democracy emphasizes constraints and correction mechanisms rather than boundaryless expansion.
