### 7. Animal Protectionism vs Anthropocentrism

#### 7.1 The entry question: must rights-holders be “human”?

In contemporary political and public-ethics debates, Animal Protectionism increasingly shifts from “moral advocacy” to “institutional claims”. This shift turns animal issues from a matter of sentiment or value preference into a political question with clear institutional consequences:

**where is the boundary of rights-holders?**

Unlike environmentalism, which mainly discusses ecosystems as public conditions, Animal Protectionism touches the core question of the Rights Ontology Axis (Z): **who can be treated as a rights-holder, and whether rights are necessarily a pre-political arrangement among humans**. On this point, Animal Protectionism and Anthropocentrism form a clear and unavoidable opposition.

This section does not adjudicate which stance is “morally superior”. It uses the Political Triple-Axis Model to analyze their positioning on Z and the institutional consequences.

#### 7.2 Anthropocentrism: an institutional premise of Z+, not moral coldness

Under Anthropocentrism’s understanding of rights:

- rights-holders are limited to humans;  
- animals are not rights-holders, but objects that humans may legitimately use, manage, protect, or constrain;  
- the legitimacy of protecting animals comes from human interests, moral choices, or social order, not from animals’ own rights claims.  

In this model, Anthropocentrism does not equal “indifference” or “cruelty”. Its core is not an emotional attitude, but an **institutional premise**:

> rights must be adjudicable, symmetric, and pre-political, and under existing institutions these conditions can only stably apply to human agents.

This is why Anthropocentrism is treated here as a Z+ institutional premise, not as a moral label.

#### 7.3 Animal Protectionism: when animals become rights-holders

Animal Protectionism becomes structurally decisive when it shifts from “welfare improvement” (humans choosing to limit harm) to “animals as rights-holders” (institutions recognizing enforceable claims).

Two moves matter most:

- expanding the rights-holder set beyond humans;  
- constructing enforceable institutional obligations that bind human action.

This tends to pull:

- Z leftward (toward Z−), because rights-holders and rights scope are redefined institutionally;  
- Y leftward (toward Y−), because enforcement expands into daily life and production/consumption;  
- X can also shift as production systems (food, research, industry) face reorganizing constraints.

#### 7.4 Institutional Stability Domain (ISD) implications: adjudicability is the key

The key risk is not “how many rights” or “how strong the moral claim is”. It is whether rights remain adjudicable.

As a rough rule of thumb:

- when animal protection stays at welfare improvement and procedural constraints, Z often remains around +2 to +3 and can stay within ISD;  
- when animals are elevated into near-symmetric rights-holders relative to humans, Z shifts left quickly; rights politics intensifies; Y and X change structurally; institutional risk rises sharply.

This shows: institutional stability hinges less on moral intensity than on whether rights remain adjudicable.
