### 15. Nazism: The “Far Right” Label

In public language, Nazism is often treated as synonymous with “the far right”. A common line of reasoning is: communism is called “Left”; Nazism consistently opposed communism in ideology, political practice, and targets of repression; therefore Nazism is “far right”. This reasoning is common at the level of labels and camp semantics. One major mechanism is projection: once “Left / Right” is simplified into “communism / anti-communism”, “extreme anti-communism” is automatically projected as “far right”. In that projection, “Right” primarily points to an enemy-camp position rather than a structural coordinate on the three axes.

Once placed into the Political Triple-Axis Model, we find: **this opposition does not mean Nazism belongs to an X-right “economic right-liberalism”. On the contrary, on the three axes Nazism is closer to the negative extremes on X-left (X−), Y-left (Y−), and Z-left (Z−). The structural roots of its anti-communism concentrate mainly on Z (Rights Ontology Axis) and Y (Liberty Boundary Axis).**

#### 15.1 Nazism’s three-axis positioning

- X: Economic Order Axis: closer to the left (X−): formally it allowed private property and firms to exist, but economic order was clearly dominated by state goals and war mobilization; resources, industry, and labor were strongly organized, and the market was absorbed into the mobilization system.  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Far Left (Y−): state coercion was almost unconstrained; governance tools were normalized; social life was comprehensively politicized.  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: Far Left (Z−): rights were mainly treated as Institutional Rights, defined and allocated by the state–community; therefore “who counts as a rights-holder” could be politically rewritten, accompanied by systematic exclusion, downgrading, and deprivation (in the Nazi context, the community was further racialized and hierarchized).  

On the Economic Order Axis, the most misleading factor is precisely “the formal presence of markets and private ownership”. To avoid mistaking institutional appearance for order mechanism, a more comparable formulation is:

- Nazism ≠ (Soviet-style) planned economy  
- Nazism ≠ free-market economy  
- Nazism = Instrumentalized Market  

The key is not whether “markets still exist”, but “who decides economic order”. When the decision authority shifts from a price–contract order to state mobilization goals, even if private property remains formally present, the economic order has already departed from the dominant coordination logic on X-right (X+), and shifted toward X-left.

#### 15.2 If both Nazism and Communism are closer to X−/Y−/Z−, why did Nazism oppose Communism so fiercely?

Even when two ideologies occupy similar directions on the three axes, they can still conflict intensely, because they may collide on “how rights-holders and the political community are defined” and on “which identity boundary is treated as the fundamental unit”.

We can separate three main conflict levels:

**1) Political level (Political Level)**  
At the political level, they competed as totalizing mobilization regimes: each claimed monopoly over legitimacy, organization, and the definition of enemies. In such regimes, “the other side” is not a normal competitor but an existential threat.

**2) Rights-holder and community level (Rights-holder / Community Level)**  
This is closer to the Z axis and the overlay variable layer:

- rights-holders: communism defines rights-holders through class universalism and tends to treat class as a transnational community of interests; Nazism defines the political community through nation/race and demands that class submit to the national community (Volksgemeinschaft).  
- internationalism: communism emphasizes international worker unity and transnational political identity; Nazism emphasizes the nation-state, racial boundaries, and Lebensraum.  
- egalitarianism: communism uses a kind of universal equality as justificatory language; Nazism makes racial hierarchy and community exclusion the premise for rights allocation.  

These conflicts are easily projected into “Left / Right camps”. In three-axis language, however, they correspond more directly to: who can be a rights-holder, how the political community is defined (Z), and which overlay contexts—especially Nationalism / Internationalism—make that definition appear as a stronger exclusionary structure.

**3) Economic level (Economic Level)**  
This is the level most often misread and most in need of precise phrasing. Nazism opposed communist economic institutions, but that does not mean it supported free markets. More accurately:

- Nazism opposed: public ownership, class struggle, worker self-government, and social ownership of the means of production.  
- Nazism also did not support: free competition, independent unions, and treating property as a strong boundary that cannot be penetrated by political goals.  

This matches the X-axis positioning above: Nazism’s economy was closer to “private forms exist + directive state control + economy serves political goals” (Instrumentalized Market), rather than the spontaneous market order on X-right.

#### 15.3 Does the “old aristocratic right” imply Nazism is “right” because it is another hierarchy?

One view argues: the original meaning of “Right” is tied to hierarchical orders—such as monarchs and nobles in the French Revolution—and Nazism is a continuation of hierarchy in another form, so it should be “Right”.

As analyzed in Chapter II, in contemporary politics “Right” is no longer confined to traditional hierarchy. It has expanded into multidimensional distinctions across economy, society, and rights; the concept of “Right” has been decoupled from hierarchy as its core.

From a contemporary perspective under the three-axis model:
- on the economic axis, the old monarchical–aristocratic order did recognize private property and some market exchange, but it was far from a free market; many economic powers were concentrated in a few strata and heavily constrained by political and status hierarchies, so it was closer to neutral-to-left;  
- it clearly leaned toward high control and low liberty, so on the Liberty Boundary Axis it was closer to Y−;  
- it defined rights by rank, a political construction of rights, so on the Rights Ontology Axis it was closer to Z−;  
therefore, the “aristocratic right” of that era would in this model actually be closer to the left side.

In that era, the market concept was indeed less developed, especially with labor markets being unfree and personal status heavily constrained. Commodity exchange was often under noble and monarchical control, not a fully free market. Later bourgeois revolutions sought to break these old rank constraints, making labor markets freer and enabling goods and resources to flow more freely. The French Revolution is usually treated as part of this broader bourgeois revolutionary arc: it overthrew the old estate hierarchy and broke rigid controls over market and society, paving the way for a broader free-market economy. In this sense, the meaning of “Left / Right” then differs sharply from today.

On Z, Nazism treated rights as shaped by politics and racial hierarchy, not as an innate, pre-political equal right. Through racial ideology, Nazism defined rights—asserting that some races were born with higher rights, while other races’ rights could be downgraded or even stripped.

#### 15.4 Summary

“Opposing communism” is neither a sufficient condition nor a necessary condition for being “Right”. Liberal right positions may oppose communism because they oppose state control. Authoritarian nationalism may oppose communism because it opposes egalitarianism and internationalism. They oppose different layers of communism.

Nazism opposed communism **not because it believed in individual liberty, but because communism threatened Nazism’s monopolistic definition of “rights-holders” and the “political community”.**

> In political practice and ideology, the Nazi regime consistently treated communism as a primary enemy. However, this opposition did not stem from defending free markets or individual rights, but from a deeper rights-ontology conflict. Communism presupposed class universalism and egalitarianism; Nazism, by contrast, claimed that the state and race construct rights-holders and denied any form of universal equality. Therefore, Nazi anti-communism should not be interpreted simply as “the Right opposing the Left”, but as a confrontation between two different totalizing logics of rights construction.
