### 4. Hostility Narratives and Scapegoating Mechanisms: Antisemitism

In the Political Triple-Axis Model, Antisemitism is better treated as a **cross-camp “explanation-and-mobilization template”** rather than as a position necessarily implied by any ontological axis. It can recur on both the so-called “far right” and the so-called “far left” not because of the Left/Right labels themselves, but because it offers a shortcut: compressing a complex world into a single blame target. Once that shortcut is activated, debate often slides from policy disputes into rewriting rights-holders (Z) and loosening coercion boundaries (Y).

This section addresses three common questions:

- Why does Nazi antisemitism—given that Nazism is often labeled “far right”—make “antisemitism = far right” look intuitive?  
- Why are many contemporary groups labeled “far right” antisemitic, even though their three-axis positioning is not necessarily “far right”?  
- Why did postwar left-wing forces support Jewish state-building, while part of the contemporary U.S. left shows strong antisemitic slippage in Israel–Palestine contexts—and how is that structurally different from Nazi antisemitism?  

#### 4.1 Fix the object first: Antisemitism ≠ criticism of Israeli policy ≠ a stance on Israel–Palestine

Under this paper’s terminology rules, the minimal identification point of Antisemitism is not “pro-Israel or pro-Palestine”. It is whether the narrative structure shows the following slippages:

- the object of argument shifts from **falsifiable state behavior/policy** (e.g., a military operation; a border-governance measure) to “Jews/Jewishness” as **group essence**;  
- the unit of responsibility shifts from individuals/specific organizations/specific government decisions to “global Jews as one responsibility-bearing subject” (de-individualized blame);  
- explanation shifts from multi-causal institutional analysis to an “omnipotent explanation term” (backstage manipulators, an absolute evil center, a supra-national conspiracy network).

(Two boundary reminders: anti-Judaism and anti-Zionism are often entangled with Antisemitism in practice, but they are not identical. The key is still whether blame becomes totalizing and de-individualized.)

#### 4.2 Why both “far right” and “far left” can become antisemitic: two assembly paths of one template

##### (1) Cognitive Lens

In different camps, Antisemitism rarely appears as “I am advocating antisemitism”. It often enters as a byproduct of a Cognitive Lens: the lens first reorganizes reality into a few agents and simplified causal chains, and then provides a reusable default grammar for selecting blame targets. When this grammar assigns high explanatory power to “Jews/Jewishness”, the antisemitic motif is automatically called.

Two lenses summarize the most common entry routes (they explain “entry structure”, not camp classification):

**Lens A: Conspiracy–Manipulation Lens**  
- Minimal scenario: when social dissatisfaction is expressed as “being controlled by a few”, people seek a visualizable “backstage controller” to carry anger and explain failure; “Jewish elites/Jewish finance/Jewish media” are then repeatedly reused as ready-made targets.  
- Typical three-axis consequences: on Z, responsibility slides from specific actors to an abstract group (Z drifts toward −); on Y, tolerance for exclusion, surveillance, and exception governance rises (greater acceptability of Y drifting toward −). X does not determine whether this lens forms, but financialization, globalization, and crisis narratives provide materials for “personifying structural anxiety”.

**Lens B: Oppressor–Oppressed Lens and symbolic-structure slippage**  
- Minimal scenario: when a complex international conflict is compressed into a single “oppressor vs oppressed” structure, Israel can become symbolized as the key sign of “colonialism/oppression”. If critique of “the Israeli government/war actions” further slips into “Zionists/Jews as an integrated world power” or “global Jews as one responsibility-bearing subject”, de-individualized blame is triggered again (Z−).  
- Typical three-axis consequences: on Z, rights-holders are more easily rewritten as identity-totalities (Z drifts toward −). Y can be less stable, but when friend–enemy narratives intensify, acceptance space for exclusionary language, punitive justification, and exception governance can still expand (greater acceptability of Y drifting toward −). In real diffusion, this lens often mutually reinforces with Identity Politics, anti-colonial narratives, and platform diffusion structures—raising the probability of blame-target slippage.

##### (2) Returning Antisemitism to the three axes

- **Z (Rights Ontology Axis):** rewriting the rights-holder. A typical move is rewriting “Jews/Jewishness” from disputable political subjects into non-disputable responsibility subjects, thereby withdrawing or conditionalizing their status as rights-holders (a Z→− move).  
- **Y (Liberty Boundary Axis):** loosening coercion boundaries. Once a narrative frames a group as “systemic threat / non-negotiable evil”, tolerance for exclusion, surveillance, violence, and exception governance rises (greater acceptability of Y→−).  
- **X (Economic Order Axis):** does not decide whether antisemitism happens, but often supplies materials for personification: financialization, globalization, crisis, and inequality are compressed into “a group’s will”, replacing complex causality with a single blame target.

So Antisemitism corresponds more stably to Z− (often coupled with Y−) than to any fixed Left/Right label.

#### 4.3 Why “Nazism = far right” is a common projection, and what three-axis questions classify Nazism more reliably

The common public path is: Nazism is labeled “far right” → Nazism is antisemitic → antisemitism is “far right”. But the more reliable method is to ask, on the three axes, whether the combination below holds:

- **Z:** does it place membership/civilizational boundary/identity category above individual rights, allowing stratification or exclusion of rights-holders (closer to Z−)?  
- **Y:** does it tolerate coercion expansion in the name of security/order and normalize governance against “internal enemies” (closer to Y−)?  
- **X:** does it argue for goal-directed economic mobilization, industrial control, or redistribution by the state (closer to X−/X0), or for a more X+ market spontaneous order?

Replacing “is it far right?” with these questions breaks the intuition-binding between “Nazism = far right” and “antisemitism = far right”. The antisemitic template corresponds more stably to Z− (often coupled with Y−), not to a fixed “Right” label.

#### 4.4 Why postwar left forces supported Israeli state-building, and why part of the contemporary U.S. left shows antisemitic slippage

A minimal causal chain helps explain an apparent “within-camp contradiction”:

- **1945–1948:** Holocaust memory and refugee conditions made “Jewish survival security” highly salient; meanwhile, early state-building forces in Israel had visible Labor/Kibbutz traditions, so they were not automatically projected as “a right-wing state”.  
- **After 1967:** war outcomes, occupation, and border governance pushed Y-axis disputes to the foreground; once Israel was incorporated into U.S. geopolitical alliance structures, overlay-level camp narratives (Cold War and post–Cold War) further changed its “symbolic position” within left narratives.  
- **After the New Left and the rise of Identity Politics:** when an Oppressor–Oppressed interpretive paradigm becomes the main mobilization entry point, Palestinians become more stably identified as “the oppressed”, while Israel becomes more stably identified as “the oppressor holding state coercive capacity”. This is less “principles reversed” than “object salience switched”.

The key structural risk is: when “opposition to occupation / criticism of a policy” (state–war level) repeatedly slips into “denying Jews’ status as rights-holders” (identity–rights level), or when “criticizing the Israeli government” is replaced by “identifying Zionists/Jews as the backstage center of global oppression structure”, the antisemitic template is activated.

#### 4.5 Nazi antisemitism vs contemporary U.S. far-left antisemitic slippage: structural homology and key differences

They are discussed together not because they “share positions”, but because both can trigger the same structural action: rewriting an identity group from a “disputable political subject” into a “non-disputable responsibility subject” (de-individualized blame on Z−).

But there are at least three concrete differences:

- **Different implementation paths on Z:** Nazi antisemitism institutionalized and legalized “Jews are not rights-holders” and drove it into executable extermination policy. Contemporary U.S. far-left antisemitic slippage more often appears at the discourse and mobilization layer (e.g., treating “Jewishness/Zionism” as an all-purpose key for explaining the world); its institutionalization level and state-violence reach are usually not of the same order.  
- **Different accessibility on Y:** Nazism corresponds to extreme Y− (coercion boundaries nearly unlimited). Contemporary U.S. radical left discourse in domestic politics often aims to expand rights protection and constrain coercion abuse (closer to Y0/Y+ in language), but in international conflict narratives it can still adopt friend–enemy expressions, placing external targets into a semantic position of “overall blameability”.  
- **Different collective-subject settings (overlay differences):** Nazism’s collective subject is an ethnic/national state, with antisemitism functioning as a core mechanism of community purification. Contemporary U.S. far-left collective subjects are more often framed as “oppressed identities / the Global South / anti-colonial alliances”, with antisemitic slippage more likely to occur through the chain “symbolization of structure + de-individualized blame”.

#### 4.6 Extremist Islamist antisemitism: three-axis positioning only, no empirical assertions here

Antisemitic narratives in extremist Islamist contexts often approximate a combination of “eschatological/theological enemy” and “community purification”: strengthened Z− (rewriting rights-holders via faith-community boundaries) coupled with strengthened Y− (legitimizing violence/coercion as tools), under overlay contexts of Religion / Secularization. This section notes structural homology only, and does not expand into detailed textual or sect history.

#### 4.7 Section summary

Antisemitism is not a stance that can be stably described by a Left/Right label. It is an explanation-and-mobilization template that can parasitize across camps. In three-axis terms, a more testable conclusion is: it usually corresponds to Z− (shrinking/re-writing rights-holders) and often reinforces Y− (coercion expansion). Its different appearances across the so-called “far right/far left” are largely shaped by Overlay Variables (Nationalism / Internationalism, Religion / Secularization, Identity Politics, media environment, and so on).
