### 9. Institutional Stability Domain: The Intersection of the Three Low-Risk Zones

In addition to “how to position stances,” this paper provides an auxiliary tool for discussing whether institutions can operate stably over the long run: the Institutional Stability Domain (ISD).

- Definition: ISD is not a new ontological axis and not a political stance. It is the intersection of the low-risk intervals on each of the three main axes. It represents a space of institutional combinations that are more likely to remain workable, correctable, and sustainable over time.
- Use: When using ISD to explain how political crises emerge, the focus is not on value goals themselves, but on whether an institutional path pushes the trajectory away from the stability domain. The same slogan system can, along different paths, move into different risk zones.
- One key conclusion: Under the paper’s risk framework, the stable zone of the Z Rights Ontology Axis is closer to the right side and narrower. This means that “the pre-institutional character of rights + stable institutional carriers” tends to be more sensitive in discussions of institutional stability.
