### 1. Mandating coercive public-health measures under public-health risk

#### 1.1 Initial Position: institutional default of bodily autonomy priority

In most modern liberal-democratic systems, public-health governance has long rested on a relatively stable default structure whose core feature is **priority of bodily autonomy**.

In the Political Triple-Axis Model, this default can be summarized as:

- **Z (Rights Ontology Axis):** individuals’ disposition over their own bodies is treated as a pre-political right; institutions recognize and protect rather than redefine or systematically intervene (Z+).  
- **Y (Liberty Boundary Axis):** direct state coercion into the body is strictly limited, treated as justified only in extreme, case-specific situations, usually under strong procedural constraints (Y+).  
- **X (Economic Order Axis):** health-related resources are mainly allocated through markets and professional systems; the state primarily subsidizes, coordinates, and provides a safety net rather than directly allocating uniformly.

Under this structure, public-health policy tends to use recommendations, incentives, compensation, and information disclosure rather than coercion as a routine tool.

#### 1.2 Contextual Scenario: infectious risk with strong externalities

Consider a scenario:

- an infectious disease spreads through daily contact;  
- whether individuals take health behaviors (vaccination, isolation, protective measures) significantly affects others’ infection risk;  
- purely voluntary choice is believed insufficient to achieve population-level control within limited time.

The core dispute is not “whether the disease is real”. It is whether **individual bodily choices can still be treated as private affairs affecting only oneself**.

#### 1.3 Motion Statement

**When there is significant public-health risk, the state should, through coercive public-health measures, require individuals to yield part of bodily autonomy in specified matters to achieve overall health-safety goals.**

The core is not denying bodily autonomy’s value. It is **re-ordering institutional priorities**:

- placing public-health safety before bodily autonomy;  
- elevating coercive measures from exceptional tools to potentially routinizable governance tools.

#### 1.4 Structural Consequences: coercion boundary moves forward; allocation becomes more state-led

If institutionalized, consequences appear on all three axes:

- **Z:** bodily autonomy shifts from a pre-political right into a right that is conditionalized under public goals; inviolability is weakened (Z→−).  
- **Y:** the state gains institutional legitimacy to enter the bodily domain; coercion shifts from “rear-guard exception” to “front-loaded instrument” (Y→−).  
- **X:** health and epidemic-control resource allocation becomes more state-led: centralized procurement, unified allocation, expanded subsidies/compensation; markets may remain, but state dominance increases.

This drift is often path-dependent: even after the triggering risk declines, the advanced coercion boundary and centralized allocation are hard to fully revert.
