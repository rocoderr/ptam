### 5. Extension I: from static positioning to dynamic trajectories (Trajectories)

Real political stances are often not fixed points but trajectories over time. Under crises, wars, technological change, or generational shifts, one axis can move faster while others remain relatively stable.

This extension follows naturally from the Motion concept: a motion is an institutional claim at a time point that tries to push a directional drift on X/Y/Z.

If we line up, in time order, a set of motions that the same actor proposes/supports/opposes, we obtain a “motion sequence”. If we map each motion’s drift on X/Y/Z, the sequence becomes a trajectory: it answers “which axis changed and why”, instead of compressing change into “the label changed”.

A minimal trajectory description:

- mark an actor’s relative X/Y/Z position in a period;  
- after a shock, describe which axis drifted most and the causal chain for that drift;  
- separate overlay-layer changes (e.g., rising nationalism, religious revival, media-ecology change) from main-axis drift.

The benefit is that readers can see “where change occurred” rather than only “labels changed”.
