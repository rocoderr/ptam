### 5. Recognizing fetuses as rights-holders and restricting abortion

#### 5.1 Initial Position: institutional priority of women’s bodily autonomy

In systems where abortion is legal or highly permissive, pregnancy-related decisions are typically placed under women’s bodily autonomy protection:

- **Z:** women’s decision power over body and pregnancy is treated as a pre-political right; institutions recognize and protect rather than substantively judge it (Z+).  
- **Y:** state intervention is strictly limited, often only via procedural/time/medical marginal constraints; coercion is rear-guard (Y+).  
- **X:** relevant medical services are provided by professional systems and markets; state involvement centers on regulation and accessibility, not deciding individual choice.

Under this structure, pregnancy is treated as highly private, and the state does not independently adjudicate fetal rights.

#### 5.2 Contextual Scenario: institutional claim of fetal personhood and life value

This motion is often proposed when:

- the fetus is claimed to have independent life value or personhood;  
- abortion is redescribed as substantive harm to another life;  
- the current system is claimed to recognize only one side’s rights while ignoring another potential rights-holder.

The core dispute becomes whether institutions should recognize the fetus as a rights-holder and thereby rewrite rights structure.

#### 5.3 Motion Statement

**Assuming the fetus is recognized as an independent rights-holder, the state should, through law, impose clear limits on abortion to protect fetal right to life.**

The key is not technical restrictions but **institutional expansion of rights-holders** and re-ordering of rights priorities.

#### 5.4 Structural Consequences: rights-holder expansion and conditionalization of bodily autonomy

- **Z:** the rights-holder set expands from the pregnant person to include the fetus; women’s bodily autonomy ceases to be a right not vetoable by other rights and becomes conditionalized (Z→−).  
- **Y:** state coercion enters reproductive decision domain, not only at procedural/time margins but at pregnancy permissibility itself (Y→−).  
- **X:** the medical system and reproductive services face stronger institutional constraints; professional judgment is partially displaced by legal judgment.

The essence is rewriting rights hierarchy by recognizing a new rights-holder.
