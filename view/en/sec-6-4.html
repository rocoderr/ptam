### 4. Communism

In this chapter, Communism mainly refers to an ideal type whose typical path is “abolishing private property, building highly centralized organization, and reconstructing society through revolution—vanguard party—mass mobilization”.

**Three-axis positioning (ideal type)**

- X: Economic Order Axis: Strong Left (X−) (centralized allocation and public ownership arrangements)  
- Y: Liberty Boundary Axis: Strong Left (Y−) (coercion boundaries expand; mobilization and governance tools become normalized)  
- Z: Rights Ontology Axis: Strong Left (Z−) (rights are highly institutionalized; individual rights can be overridden by collective goals)  

**Structural core**

The structural core of Communism is not a single axis, but the simultaneous convergence of X, Y, and Z toward the left (X−/Y−/Z−): economic reconstruction relies on centralized organization; political mobilization relies on expanded coercion boundaries; and rights-holders and rights scope are uniformly defined by institutional goals.

**Rights Ontology Axis: whether relevant rights are treated as basic rights**

- Social Security Rights and Labor Rights are more likely to undergo Rights Escalation into basic rights that are difficult to veto.  
- Property Rights and Contract Rights are more likely to undergo Conditionalization of Rights; their boundaries can be redefined with institutional goals.  

**Overlay Variable notes (per Chapter V categories)**

- Revolution / Reform  
  - pull mechanism: when revolutionary narratives intensify, Y more readily moves left (toward Y−) and pushes normalized mobilization; reform paths can pull Y back toward the midpoint (Y0).  
- Nationalism / Internationalism  
  - pull mechanism: internationalism stresses transnational class community and pulls rights-holders toward class universalism; when nationalism strengthens, the weight of Membership-Based Rights rises and Z more readily deepens leftward (toward Z−).  

Communism’s core economic theory: the theory of exploitation and surplus value.

**Background Conditions (if relevant)**

- Security Risks: as war and external threats rise, Y more readily solidifies on the left and normalizes mobilization structures.  
- economic collapse and breaks in state capacity: when the existing order fails, centralized organization is more likely to be seen as viable, making leftward movement on X more stable.  

**Typical tensions and common misreadings**

Communism is often simplified as “economically left”, but its historical risks concentrate more on Y/Z: whether coercion boundaries are constrained, and whether rights are instrumentalized institutionally. Treating it only as an X-axis position underestimates its structural constraints and rights-rewriting mechanisms.
