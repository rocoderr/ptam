### 7. Existing Left–Right Frameworks: Main Types and Their Problems

Historically, many analytical principles, models, and explanatory frameworks were proposed to interpret Left–Right. They often targeted the most salient conflicts of their time and tried to compress complexity into a discussable coordinate system. But across longer historical spans and more complex combinations of issues, these frameworks repeatedly run into structural problems. This section places the most common types side by side: what each tries to solve, and what problems each repeatedly encounters.

Three types are compared here: the one-dimensional left–right spectrum, Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Models, and “add-more-axes” Multi-Axis Political Models and multi-dimensional scales.

#### 7.1 The One-Dimensional Left–Right Spectrum: Why It Becomes Unavoidably Vague

The one-dimensional model arranges political positions along a single line from left to right. In different contexts, this line is often interpreted as:

- left = equality vs right = liberty  
- left = collective vs right = individual

**Minimal scenario: why “equality vs liberty” distorts**

Consider a minimal scenario: should the government impose mandatory licensing and entry restrictions on a certain industry?

- If the discussion focuses on liberty, it is asking: should the boundary of public coercion move outward?  
- If the discussion focuses on equality, it is asking: should access opportunities and the distribution of returns be rearranged?

On a one-dimensional axis, these two discussions are treated as opposite ends of the same question. But in fact they are two different structural questions: one is about where coercion should end; the other is about how access and distribution should be organized.

**Unpacking “equality”: equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome**

Even if we talk only about equality, it has at least several common meanings:

- **Equality of Opportunity**: symmetric rules, with room for outcome divergence.  
- **Equality of Outcome/Result**: a goal closer to outcome convergence, usually requiring stronger redistribution and regulatory tools.  
- **Equity**: in public debate, often means asymmetric adjustments to opportunities or outcomes for corrective purposes; it is usually closer to the outcome-equality path, but it is not identical to equality of outcome.  

Putting all of these into one bucket of “left = equality” makes readers think “equality” is itself a clear coordinate, when it is not.

**Why “collective vs individual” is also not rigorous**

“Left = collective vs right = individual” sounds more intuitive, but it is also not rigorous. It compresses three different objects into a slogan, and readers cannot tell which structural line the discussion actually sits on.

Here is a minimal scenario: a person supports universal health insurance funded by public finance, and also supports strict limits on the normalization of emergency powers—opposing the permanent institutionalization of temporary coercive measures in the name of public health or public security. It is hard to classify this position by “collective / individual”, because the first claim mainly answers how economic organization and redistribution should be arranged, while the second mainly answers where the boundary of coercion should be drawn.

Treating “collective / individual” as a single axis produces three typical confusions:

- **Mixing economic organization with the coercion boundary**:  
  “collective” can mean stronger redistribution and public provision, but it can also mean a wider coercion boundary and more normalized governance tools. They often co-occur in real politics, but they are not the same question and are not logically bound.

- **Mixing “who decides” with “who is served”**:  
  “collective” sometimes means the goal is public interest, and sometimes means decision power is centralized in the state or an organization. The former is a goal narrative; the latter is about coercion and procedural structure.

- **Hiding rights ontology as “individualism / collectivism temperament”**:  
  In conflicts about rights, the real fork is often whether rights are understood as prior boundaries, or as institutional constructions that can be adjusted. Writing it as “individualism / collectivism temperament” makes the disagreement look like a preference, rather than a difference in argumentative structure.

#### 7.2 Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Models: The Nolan Chart and the Political Compass

Two-Dimensional Liberty–Intervention Models make a real contribution by “separating economic liberty from personal liberty”. They are often represented by the Nolan Chart and the Political Compass.

They reduce one-dimensional compression by allowing combinations such as “more market-oriented economically but more conservative / more controlling socially”, or “more redistribution economically but more libertarian socially”. But they still repeatedly encounter one structural problem: their axis objects easily become ambiguous.

- The “economic liberty” line often mixes two kinds of questions: how the economy is organized (the basic arrangement of property, allocation, and distribution), and where the boundary of regulation and coercion is drawn.  
- The “personal liberty” line often compresses two kinds of questions into one “degree of liberty”: the contraction/expansion of the coercion boundary, and whether rights are understood as prior boundaries or as institutional products.

**Minimal scenario: why rights ontology is hard for two-dimensional models to absorb**

Consider a minimal scenario: should a platform, outside the law, systematically restrict a certain kind of speech through its internal rules?

In this scenario, there are at least two separable judgments:

- How to draw the coercion boundary between platforms and the state: which restrictions are treated as “acceptable normalized governance tools”?  
- Whether freedom of expression is understood as a prior boundary, or as a rights structure that can be institutionally rewritten.

Two-dimensional models often have to push all of this into “higher / lower personal liberty”, which hides disagreements about rights ontology.

#### 7.3 Multi-Axis Political Models and Multi-Dimensional Scales: Why “Adding Axes” Often Fails

Beyond one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, another common approach is to keep adding dimensions, producing Multi-Axis Political Models or multi-dimensional scales. The usual starting point is that real issues are too many for one or two axes.

But “adding axes” often creates new confusion for three common reasons:

1. **Mixed abstraction levels**: ontological axes, policy issues, and psychological tendencies are put on the same layer.  
   When axes are named directly as “pro / anti on issue X”, the model drifts with time-specific hot topics. Readers get a checklist of disputes rather than a reusable structural language.

2. **Uncontrolled overlap between axes**: correlation is mistaken for independent dimensions.  
   For example, people add axes such as “security preference”, “order preference”, or “state-capacity preference”. But these often correlate strongly with the expansion/contraction of the coercion boundary. They either provide motives and justifications for boundary changes, or describe Background Conditions that allow coercive tools to be implemented. Treating them as independent coordinates often double-counts the same kind of difference.

3. **Situational factors are promoted by mistake**: “presentation” is treated as a “root disagreement”.  
   Nationalism, religious traditions, identity politics, and media ecology can strongly reshape how the same structural disagreements are expressed and mobilized in public space. But they do not necessarily form new main axes that are reusable across contexts and stably orthogonal to other coordinates.

Viewed together, these three framework types suggest an empirical lesson: when a model tries to cover more complex conflicts with fewer axes, the common price is confusion; when it tries to accommodate more issues by adding more axes, the common price is mixed levels and overlapping dimensions. Left–right frameworks thus swing back and forth between being “too coarse” and “too scattered”.
