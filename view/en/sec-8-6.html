### 6. Mechanisms for Cashing Out Consequences: Cancel Culture

Cancel Culture is defined here as a **consequence-cashing mechanism**. It does not mainly specify “what can be said”; it answers “**what happens after you say it**”, by turning moral condemnation into repeatable real losses through concentrated social sanction. Its key feature is: it does not rely on judicial rulings, yet can persistently and repeatedly convert condemnation into concrete costs.

#### 6.1 Operating logic: from norm judgment to real punishment

Cancel culture often follows this structural path:

- **trigger:** some speech/behavior/past record is identified as violating dominant norms;  
- **focus:** public opinion, social media, or internal organizational notices produce a convergent attribution of blame;  
- **cash-out:** pressure is converted at key nodes into concrete consequences: contract termination, firing, bans, de-platforming, de-cooperation, or industry exclusion.

The key is not condemnation itself, but whether consequences are **concentrated and institutionally cashed out**.

#### 6.2 Substantive impact on speech liberty (Y)

Cancel culture affects speech liberty far more strongly than ordinary public criticism:

- when expression can directly lead to loss of job, income, or public participation opportunities, individuals may be “legally allowed to speak” but cannot bear the real cost;  
- then Y shifts markedly leftward (often around Y−2 to Y−3), because refusal space and disagreement space are compressed in fact.

The key is not whether sanctions come from the state, but whether **refusal remains practically feasible**.

#### 6.3 Systematic shock to procedural justice

Cancel culture’s main tension with rule-of-law structure is its replacement of procedural justice:

- **no clear accusation procedure:** blame is framed via moral narrative rather than checkable specific charges;  
- **weak burden-of-proof and rebuttal mechanisms:** the accused often must self-prove “no fault”, rather than accusers bearing proof;  
- **merging judgment and enforcement:** public opinion judgment and consequence enforcement occur simultaneously, with little buffering.

These features structurally **bypass the presumption of innocence**, even when participants do not intend to deny it.

#### 6.4 De facto weakening of the presumption of innocence

Common patterns include:

- “if you had no problem, you wouldn’t cause such a reaction”;  
- “explaining is just sophistry”.

This is not legal doctrine, but it functions as a **de facto presumption of guilt**: once an accusation stabilizes at the discourse layer, the accused bears continuous self-justification burdens, and consequences often arrive before factual clarification.

#### 6.5 Interface with Z (Rights Ontology Axis)

Cancel culture is often justified by “group harm”, “structural oppression”, or “safety risk”:

- when such reasons are elevated into non-debatable rights boundaries, Z shifts leftward (often around Z−1 to Z−2);  
- rights no longer function only as constraints on institutions; they become **triggers that bypass institutional procedure**.

In this structure, cancel culture is not merely moral misbehavior. It is a **non-state, de-proceduralized coercion form**.
