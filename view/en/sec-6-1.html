### 1. Analytical Principles: Ideal-Type Positioning and “-isms” as Positioned Objects

To make different objects comparable, this chapter uses a unified writing template:

- **Three-axis positioning (X/Y/Z)**: answers three question types—economic organization, coercion boundaries, and rights ontology.  
- **Structural core (what it prioritizes)**: in a few sentences, what kind of problem the ideology most wants to solve, and why it became a stable tradition in political history.  
- **Typical tensions and common misreadings**: the most common cross-axis mixes or within-axis splits, and why public semantics misprojects it onto “Left / Right”.  
- **Overlay Variable notes**: which overlay contexts most easily shape it into specific historical forms (war mobilization, nationalism, religious tradition, media structure, etc.).  

In notation, this paper uses X/Y/Z as axis shorthand and the sign convention “Left = −, Right = +”, but only as direction markers, not as value judgments.
