### 6. Environmentalism

#### 6.1 Why environmentalism is hard to position as simply left or right

In contemporary discourse, “environmentalism” is often intuitively classified into “the Left”, but this is analytically insufficient. The reason is: environmental issues do not directly answer the three ontological questions of the axes (“who allocates resources”, “should the state coerce”, “are rights prior to politics”). Environmentalism is a **goal-type issue**: it primarily targets environmental outcomes, not institutional structure.

Therefore, environmentalism is not an ideology that naturally sits on a fixed side of a fixed axis. It is a set of claims that can unfold into multiple institutional paths across the three axes. Only when environmental goals are translated into concrete institutional arrangements does three-axis positioning become possible.

#### 6.2 Basic ways environmentalism unfolds on the three axes

##### 6.2.1 X axis: economic order—environmental goals and allocation mechanisms

On the Economic Order Axis, the key disagreement is not “whether to protect the environment”, but **which allocation mechanism is used to realize environmental goals**.

**A. Market-based environmentalism (X-leaning right)**  
Typical tools include carbon taxes, emissions trading, pricing of pollution rights, green finance, and technology incentives. This path keeps the market as the main allocation mechanism, treats pollution as an externality, and “corrects the market” institutionally rather than replacing it—internalizing environmental externalities into the price system.

Its features include:
- does not deny private property;  
- does not require the state to decide production content directly;  
- uses price signals to guide behavior adjustment.  

**B. Planning- and command-oriented environmentalism (X-leaning left)**  
This path treats environmental goals as requiring direct state allocation, production constraints, and industrial restructuring by directive planning.

Its features include:
- administrative allocation and quotas replace price signals in key sectors;  
- production and consumption are reorganized toward targets;  
- failure/external costs are treated as reasons for centralized coordination.

#### 6.3 Y axis: coercion boundaries—whether environmental goals justify normalized intervention

Environmental governance often triggers Y disputes because it easily moves from “incentives” to “restrictions”. Key questions include:

- are restrictions temporary and appealable, or normalized and expanding?  
- is enforcement bounded by clear authorization and revocability, or treated as a standing emergency?  
- do governance tools stay state-centered, or spread into platforms, organizations, and professional gatekeeping?

The same environmental goal can be pursued with Y0-style bounded tools or with Y−-style expanding coercion.

#### 6.4 Z axis: rights ontology—do environmental goals rewrite rights boundaries?

Environmentalism can trigger Z disputes when it claims not only “policy necessity”, but “rights necessity”:

- if a “right to environment” is treated as an Institutional Right subject to institutional balancing, Z may remain near Z0;  
- if environmental goals are treated as overriding, non-refusable boundaries that negate other rights claims, Z can drift, and conflicts with other rights become structurally sharper.

In short: environmentalism is not “naturally left” or “naturally right”. Its positioning depends on which institutional path it takes on X and Y, and whether it rewrites rights boundaries on Z.
