## VI. Classical Ideology Analysis

This chapter begins the first step of “applying the model to objects”: using the Political Triple-Axis Model to position several classical ideologies as ideal types. The goal is not to list policy menus for each “-ism”, but to compress them into structural answers on the three axes: how economic order is organized (X: Economic Order Axis), how coercion boundaries are drawn (Y: Liberty Boundary Axis), and how rights are grounded and who counts as a rights-holder (Z: Rights Ontology Axis).

To avoid misreadings, two reminders apply throughout:

- **“Ideologies” are positioned objects, not axes**: for example, Capitalism and Socialism are placed into the three-axis space as typical objects; they are not substitutes for axis names.  
- **Positioning is ideal-typical, not measurement**: the same ideology can appear as different combinations across countries and historical stages. This chapter gives the “structural core”, and distinguishes **core axis positioning** (relatively stable) from **non-core axis positioning** (often pulled by Overlay Variables in context).
